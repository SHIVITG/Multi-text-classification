"The BJP has made a significant gain of 11 additional seats while the Congress made an overall loss of four in the biennial elections to 59 Rajya Sabha seats, consolidating the saffron party's position in the House and leaving its main rival far behind. The BJP’s 28 candidates emerged victorious in the polls held on Friday against 17 retiring members, while the Congress won only 10 seats while 14 of its members will retire next week. A calculation of tallies show that the BJP's strength in the 245-member House will go from the existing 58 to 69 and that of the Congress will fall from 54 to 50 when the new MPs take oath next week. However, a majority in the Council of States will continue to elude the BJP-led NDA. However, NDA managers are upbeat following the loss in numbers of most vocal opposition parties like the Congress and the Samajwadi Party, which won only one seat while its six members are retiring. BJP sources said treasury benches will now be more comfortably placed in the House as regional parties like the AIADMK, TRS, which has gained three more seats, YSR Congress and the BJD, all of whom are outside the NDA, have been more open to supporting the government's legislative agenda. BJP's winning spree in state Assembly polls have resulted in a steady rise in its numbers in the House, whose members are elected by assemblies, while the loss of power of the Congress in many states has led to a fall in its numerical strength.

"Rajya Sabha saw two disruptions on Thursday already and is set to resume at 3 pm after members continued to create a ruckus in the House. The scene was no different in Lok Sabha which saw relentless protests by Opposition even as the government managed to get two bills passed amid the din. The Rajya Sabha was first adjourned till 2 pm on Thursday amid sharp exchanges between former Union minister from the TDP, YS Chowdary, and the Congress members over the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014 under the UPA government. Chowdary, along with another Telugu Desam Party (TDP) member Ashok Gajapathi Raju, had resigned from the Union Cabinet a few days ago to protest against the alleged ""injustice"" being meted out to Andhra Pradesh by denying the state special category status. The TDP is a partner in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) but has off late accused the BJP of going back on its words vis-a-vis granting special status to Andhra Pradesh. The Centre, however, has said that it has been providing all the required financial assistance to Andhra Pradesh in various forms. Minutes after the House met for the day, Chowdary stood up to explain to the House why he resigned from the government, as per Rule 241 of the Upper House's procedures. As per the said Rule, a member has to read out from the text that he has to submit to the Chair beforehand. However, in his remark, Chowdary deviated from the text as he blamed the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government of going ahead with the bifurcation of Andhra state into Telangana and Andhra Pradesh ""hastily, unjustly and unscientifically"". This, and other sharp remarks from Chowdary created a furore in the Congress benches and some of its members came near the Chair's podium to protest against Chowdary's remarks. Amid the ruckus, Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the House till 2 pm, which was later again adjourned till 3 pm. Earlier, the House paid homage to its former member Hamida Habibullah who passed away two days back aged 101 years. The proceedings of Lower House were paralysed for the ninth consecutive day as Opposition parties besides the TRS and the TDP, which is a member of the ruling NDA, stormed the Well as soon as it met and continued with their noisy protests over a number of issues, including the PNB scam, special status for Andhra and increase of quota. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan first adjourned the House till noon and then for the day. However, the government pushed two bills — The Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill and The Specific Relief (Amendment) Bill — for passage amid this din and the House passed them with a voice vote. Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose party members were also in the Well, sought a discussion on the bills. With continuous protests by different parties making the prospect of any discussion improbable, the Speaker went ahead with the proceedings for the passage of bills. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said The Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill was an important piece of legislation as he sought the opposition's cooperation. The Bill notifies the period of maternity leave as part of continuous service and proposes to empower the Central government to notify the gratuity ceiling from time to time without amending the law. Moving the bill for passage, Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar said it is a very important legislation for employees, especially women. The Specific Relief (Amendment) Bill proposes to grant a party the right to seek damages from the other side in case of a breach of a business contract and to reduce the discretion of courts in such matters. Earlier, as soon as the Speaker took up the Question Hour, members from various parties trooped into the Well holding placards. When Union Minister Ram Kripal Yadav was responding to the first question on rural housing, the protesting members raised their pitch, drowning his voice. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar urged the members of the Opposition parties, including the Congress, to return to their seats and allow the House to function. He said Parliament is the 'maha panchayat' of the country where issues are discussed but the disruptions are not allowing important issues to be raised. He also thanked the Speaker for trying to ensure smooth functioning. He said the government is open to discuss issues including bank scam, Cauvery water management board and special status for Andhra Pradesh, but the House has to function first and members have to vacate the Well. As the protests continued, the House was adjourned till 12 noon minutes before it was adjourned till Friday. While members of the Congress, TMC, TDP, YSR Congress and TRS were in the Well raising slogans and holding placards, MPs from the Left were standing at their seats and shouting slogans. Since 5 March, when Parliament had met after a recess, the Lok Sabha has seen disruptions on a daily basis. Despite the House being in pandemonium, the Finance Bill and the appropriation bills were on Wednesday passed by the House without discussion.",FP Staff

"The government, on 27 February, announced a significant reduction in airfare for those going on Haj, a month after it scrapped subsidies for the pilgrimage. Union Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi described the move as a ""major step"". ""The PMO took a keen interest in this. The decision is in line with our empowerment without appeasement policy,"" Naqvi told reporters. The reduction will be applicable to passages on Air India, Saudi Airlines and Flynas, an air carrier based in Saudi Arabia, to Jeddah and Medina from 21 airports in India. The decision to cut airfares will end the ""political and economic exploitation"" of Hajis ""as was done during the Congress-led UPA regime"", Naqvi said. To drive home the point, the minister compared Haj airfares fixed during the former UPA regime and the ones for 2018. From Ahmedabad, the round fare this year will be around Rs 65,015, as against Rs 98,750 in 2013-2014. The passage from Mumbai has been brought down to around Rs 57,857, from Rs 98,750 in 2013-14.

"With just 15 days to go before the Karnataka Assembly election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed party workers on Thursday morning. His primary instruction to office-bearers was to have as many women workers on the field as men. ""Distribute the families to be targeted between all the workers. You won't need anything else to win elections. This is not about winning the Vidhan Sabha election, it is about winning at the booth-level,"" he said. The prime minister then urged party workers to ""reach each and every vote"". Ahead of the crucial polls in the southern state, Modi said that the BJP governed and fought elections solely based on the development model. ""We know other political parties hesitate to talk on development because development can be quantified. This was unacceptable to those parties which only concentrated on division. We govern and also fight elections based only on development model,"" he said. ""We walk ahead keeping unity in mind. Sabka saath, sabka vikas, is the mantra we follow. I have seen Karnataka has made up its mind on development,"" he added. Hitting out at the Congress party, Modi accused the party of ""rampant lying"" after witnessing heavy losses in the last state Assembly elections. ""Congress has resorted to rampant lying after a series of defeats in elections. In such circumstances, karyakartas must stand their ground, expose their lies and also fight their means of deceiving people by hiring foreign agencies,"" he said. Modi also claimed ""some parties"" exploited the emotions of some communities before elections and forgot about them after the polls. ""If you analyse last few elections, you will realise how few political parties have indulged only in dividing societies on religious lines. They exploit emotions of some community before the elections and forget them after the elections,"" he said. Comparing how the NDA government performed in comparison to the UPA, the prime minister said the BJP-led coalition has worked more towards infrastructural development and produced double the results in four years. ""In renewable energy sector, UPA added only 2,000 MW to the power grid while we added 7,800 MW in just four years. In solar energy sector alone, we have piled up 4,800 MW capacity as compared to a meagre 31 MW under UPA's rule,"" he claimed. Speaking of road development in Karnataka, Modi said there is close to Rs 14,000 crore worth of road works under progress. ""In Karnataka, close to Rs 14,000 crore worth of road works is under progress. It will serve as a good fortune for Karnataka for a century. While we constructed 1,750 Km of highways in four years, for Karnataka, UPA had only built half of this,"" he said. ""Had the local state government not indulged in petty politics, had they extended full cooperation, we could have achieved even better figures. I want to add more pace to our development works in Karnataka. I need your support for this to happen,"" he told party workers during the interaction. The prime minister also encouraged the voters to elect a government with complete majority. He also accused the Congress of spreading lies about a ""hung"" Assembly. ""Now that people have seen that Congress is going to lose, people have started talking about a 'hung' Assembly. They are spreading lies that there will be no clear majority. It is their conspiracy to dissuade voters from casting their vote,"" Modi said pointedly. ""Now our job is to reach each and every voter,"" he added. Claiming he was also a true Kannadiga in spirit, Modi encouraged party workers to move forward in the same manner. On the state of agriculture in Karnataka, Modi listed all the Central government schemes in place such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and said his government wanted to promote value addition. He also spoke about the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and said that during the Congress rule in the state, farmers were not able to avail these advantages due to the state's incompetency. Seeking to strengthen the sandalwood production, he said, ""Karnataka, which is known for sandalwood, lost out when Australia took specimens from the state and started producing it in its country. We have to focus on that."" However, Modi avoided answering questions on farmer suicides in the state, and instead focused on his vision for a 'sweet revolution'. ""We want to bring about 'sweet revolution' with honey. Our farmers can earn a significant amount of income with honey,"" he said. Speaking of civic apathy in Bengaluru, Modi said the state must provide for shortages that might occur in the future. ""We have to make provision for water shortages we might face 20-30 years later. I believe people are not to blame for Bengaluru's sorry state of affairs,"" he said. On Sunday, Modi interacted with BJP MPs and MLAs through his app over a variety of issues, including the ongoing 'gram swaraj' drive, which had started on 14 April and would continue till 5 May. The BJP is locked in a tough fight with the ruling Congress in Karnataka and is banking on Modi's charisma to help it come back to power in the state after five years.

Before the Centre’s rules were formulated, six electoral trusts had donated Rs 105 crore to national parties between the 2004-’05 and 2011-’12 financial years, said the  Association for Democratic Reforms. However, since the rules are not retrospective, these firms are not required to follow the rules and declare their donor details.  “Details of donors to these six electoral trusts remain unknown thereby leading to speculation on whether donations to these trusts was only a means of getting tax exemption or a way to convert black money stashed in tax havens to white money in India,” said the Association for Democratic Reforms.  It recommended that details of donors to these electoral trusts should be disclosed and the rules that apply to the trusts formed after January 2013 should also apply to them to improve transparency.

"Adult film star Stormy Daniels, who has claimed that she had an affair with US President Donald Trump, is set to be seen on a televised interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, which will be broadcast at 7 pm Eastern Time (4:30 am Indian Standard Time) on Sunday, 25 March. This will be Daniels’ first interview after  published a   on 12 January talking about how Trump’s lawyer arranged a $1,30,000 payment for her silence on an alleged sexual encounter in 2006. The interview, being hosted by Anderson Cooper, was recorded in early March, but is being broadcast only now. People will be able to view it on the CBS News’ digital streaming news service CBSN. According to media reports, the interview is being broadcast despite a restraining order being acquired by Trump’s lawyer in this regard. Daniels has maintained that the agreement is not valid as Trump was not a signatory to it. Her legal team has further alleged that Daniels was threatened with physical violence, reported  . In addition to this, the $1,30,000 payout – allegedly made by Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen using his personal money – has also attracted controversy with reports indicating that it could be violative of campaign finance laws. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued the president on 6 March, stating Trump never signed an agreement for her to keep quiet about an ""intimate"" relationship between them. Daniels received $1,30,000 under that agreement. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint
": A consolidation of Opposition votes leading to its defeat in three Lok Sabha bypolls, including its bastion Gorakhpur, is likely to send BJP top brass to the drawing board, as the country's most populous state besides Bihar are central to its strategy for winning the general elections in 2019. The fact that the BJP's key plank of Hindutva was neutralised by the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party alliance in a state ruled by its saffron mascot Yogi Adityanath has exposed chinks in its armour while boosting the Opposition's efforts of putting up a united front against it in 2019. BJP chief Amit Shah was at the party headquarters as the news of the defeat in all three Lok Sabha seats arrived. He is likely to review its performance with senior party colleagues in the coming days, sources said. The party, however, played down its defeat, saying that people tend to vote on local factors in these elections as their results have no bearing on the stability of either the central or state governments. BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao also claimed that voters seem to want to bring some amount of ""political equilibrium"" by giving encouragement to defeated parties as the saffron party has been winning Assembly elections. He noted that the BJP has lost in bypolls held earlier as well but continues to win regular Assembly elections. ""In general elections people vote to elect a government and the BJP has always been the favourite as people want guarantee of good governance which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought in politics. Bypolls have no impact on stability of a government whether at the Centre or state,"" he said. In a jolt to the party, it suffered a shock defeat in Gorakhpur, a seat vacated by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and also Phulpur, a constituency won by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya in 2014, and Araria in Bihar. The results have underscored the BJP's vulnerability in Uttar Pradesh, where together with allies it had won 73 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. The Samajwadi Party had won five seats and BSP failed to open its account. Some party MPs from the state said an alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the BSP in the next Lok Sabha elections will pose a very serious challenge. The SP had polled 22.2 percent votes and BSP 19.6 percent when a BJP wave swept the state in 2014. The two parties had polled over 20 percent votes each in the 2017 Assembly polls. The BJP alliance had got over 42 percent vote share in 2014. The presence of Bihar Chief Nitish Kumar in the NDA camp also did not help it beat RJD in Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad Assembly seats, both of which were held by the Lalu Prasad's party. Some party leaders took consolation in the BJP's improved show in Araria, where the Muslim-Yadav combine is strong. The BJP had won the seat in 2009 and 2004 as well when Kumar was also a part of its alliance. In the last Lok Sabha polls, the NDA had won 31 of the 40 seats in Bihar.",PTI
"The Congress on Thursday alleged that the BJP government has neither the policy nor the intention to get the contentious triple talaq bill passed in Parliament, and also accused it of running away from a debate on the matter. The bill, which has divided political parties and drawn criticism from several Muslim bodies, was passed by the Lok Sabha on 28 December. It now has to be passed by the Rajya Sabha to become a law. But the Congress, which supported the bill in the Lok Sabha, wants certain changes to the bill — such as making provisions for providing financial aid to Muslim women divorced through instant triple talaq — before supporting its passage in the Upper House. It accused the ruling BJP of practicing a policy that disturbs communal harmony and alleged that violence against Dalits has risen in all states where the BJP was in power. Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said even parties like the TDP and the BJD, which have stood with the BJP, were with the Opposition on the issue. Even ""independent"" parties like the INLD have distanced themselves from the BJP, he added. ""The BJP has neither the policy nor the intention to get the triple talaq bill passed in Parliament,"" he told reporters. Tiwari alleged that it was the BJP's policy to ""divide the society"" and the ruling party was running away from a debate on the matter. He said as per the traditions of the Rajya Sabha, any motion that has been taken up and if the House was adjourned the next day it is taken up. On the Dalit protests in Maharashtra, Tiwari alleged that wherever the BJP has been voted to power violence against the community has increased. ""Whenever BJP is in power or is seeking to gain power, its first attack is on breaking the society on caste and religious lines,"" he said, adding that it's attempt in Maharashtra was also to creak social harmony in the society. Senior Congress leader PL Punia alleged it was clear that the BJP and the RSS ignited violence in Koregaon village in Pune district on 1 January and the Maharashtra government failed to control the violence. He demanded immediate arrest of the two accused named in the FIR for allegedly instigating violence in Pune, and questioned why the government was protecting them. Punia alleged that the two accused, who were linked to Hindutva outfits, were stated to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. ""We demand legal action against those who were trying to disturb harmony (in the society),"" he said. He claimed that the Pune violence was spreading to other states like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. ""The BJP and RSS does the work of dividing society on caste and religious lines. Dalit atrocities also rise wherever the BJP is in power,"" he alleged. Meanwhile, the Congress also slammed the Modi government over the reported breach in the Aadhaar data, saying the right to privacy was being ""flouted with impunity"".

" A Delhi court today sought the response of Karti Chidambaram, son of senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram, on the Enforcement Directorate’s plea seeking cancellation of the interim protection from arrest to interrogate him in custody in the Aircel-Maxis case. Special CBI judge O.P. Saini asked Karti to file his response by September 18 on the plea of the ED which has also alleged that he had shown “irritation” and “anger” when confronted with documents. The ED told the court that the interim protection was granted on March 24, 2018 on the condition that Karti will appear before the investigating officer as and when directed and join the probe, alleging that the accused has violated the condition. Additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Sonia Mathur, appearing for the agency, alleged that Karti was not cooperating with the investigation, which was one of the conditions imposed on him while granting the interim relief. The agency told the court that the probe regarding FDI approval was continuing. “The accused willfully and deliberately avoided the summons issued to him since June 2016”, with the “sole aim” of derailing the proceedings, the agency claimed. “Whenever he was confronted with the documents, he showed his irritation, sometimes anger and then conveniently avoided to answer the question on one pretext or the other,” it alleged. “Though the accused did appear at times when called for investigation but used to leave mid-way while intimidating that he would not be able appear for about a week. The said modus was essentially to consult lawyers and tailor-made answered to questions asked on earlier date of examination, thus not revealing complete facts and also delaying the investigation. “It is pertinent to mention that the such tailor-made answers provided as a result of the legal assistance has mandated the need for a custodial interrogation of the accused for an affective investigation which would not be possible sans the custody of the accused,” the agency said in its plea, moved through advocates N.K. Matta and Nitesh Rana. During a brief hearing, the court asked advocate Arshdeep Singh, appearing for Karti, why his client was not joining the probe. The counsel said Karti had joined the probe on various occasions before the charge sheet was filed by the agency against him. “I (Karti) am not running away. I sought a copy of the charge sheet but they are not responding,” the counsel said, while seeking time to file a detailed reply to the plea. In its plea, the ED said that even during investigation, Karti had either remained silent or answered after consulting his lawyers. Maintaining that the apex court had directed it to complete the investigation within six months, that is by September 12, the ED alleged that the actions of the accused were “nothing but dilatory tactics” to bypass the attempt to complete probe within the time frame. On August 7, the court had extended till October 8 the interim protection from arrest granted to Chidambaram and Karti in the Aircel-Maxis cases filed by the CBI and the ED for the alleged offences of corruption and money laundering respectively. They were named in the charge sheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the case on July 19. The ED is also probing a separate money-laundering case in the Aircel-Maxis matter and a charge sheet was filed against Karti by the agency on July 13. Chidambaram and Karti have been questioned by the ED on various occasions, even though the politician has not been arrayed as an accused.

A group of ten students were detained outside the venue, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the massive BJP rally on Sunday in Bengaluru, for selling pakodas. Modi will land at the HAL airport in the heart of the city at 3.30 pm in the afternoon, take a chopper to the venue and address the rally around 4 pm, reported  In the run-up to the state election, due in late April and early May this year, BJP conducted the yatra, crisscrossing nearly all the 224 constituencies of the Assembly across the state after its national president, Amit Shah, flagged it off in November 2017. The yatra, held with a view to bring BJP back to power in the southern state on the plank of transforming Karnataka through development, was led by its state unit president and former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa and party's other state leaders. Besides Modi, party's central ministers Prakash Javadekar and Piyush Goyal who are in-charge of the BJP poll campaign in Karnataka, Ananth Kumar, DV Sadananda Gowda and Ananthkumar Hegde who hail from the state and the party's all-state leaders will also participate in the rally and address the public. Elaborate arrangements have been made for Modi's visit to the IT hub. According to  20 LED screens, three helipads and a mini healthcare unit are being set up at the venue, where the prime minister will address the rally. The report also stated that 40 departments have been created within BJP to make necessary arrangements for the rally. Over four cooking halls with 600 cooks are being set up to prepare food in 250 counters for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Auto-tippers and compactors have also been hired to remove garbage from the venue after the event is over. All roads leading to the palace grounds have been covered in saffron with a huge 40 x 80 feet stage set up at a height of 20 feet from the ground to accommodate 22 leaders, reported  . With a focus on attracting young voters and supporters, the BJP had decided to create a separate seating space for techies who wish to attend the event. ""We have invited thousands of youth, especially techies and executives of IT and biotech companies in the city to personally listen to Modi's speech though it will also be telecast live on news channels and available on YouTube,"" asserted a party official. The party's state unit has opened an online registration and is using the social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp to personally invite the youth, techies, educated class and prominent citizens to the venue, assuring them of seating arrangements. ""About 30,000 people from across the city have responded, expressing interest in attending the rally and listen to Modi's speech. We hope most of them will turn up as elaborate parking facility has been made for their vehicles at the venue,"" added the official. ""Even if we take conservative estimates, a minimum of 10,000 to 15,000 of these techies and urban voters will attend the rally on 4 February,"" a  report quoted a party member as saying. Apart from this, party volunteers will hand-deliver special passes to the registered techies and ply a special bus service to ferry their supporters to the venue from across the city, the report added. Several workers and supporters from across Karnataka are also expected to attend the rally. According to  more than 25,000 supporters from Chitradurga will be transported in 400 buses to the city to attend Modi's rally. Meticulous security arrangements have also been made for the rally at the sprawling venue in the city centre where the party is expecting at least one lakh people to attend and listen to Modi's speech. Though Modi was scheduled to address the rally on 28 January, on the conclusion of the three-month yatra that began in Bengaluru on 1 November, it was put off to 4 February, owing to his pre-occupation with other engagements.

The high court stayed the bandh, called by pro-Kannada farmers' groups in the city, on Sunday on the Mahadayi water dispute issue. Passing an interim order, a division bench of acting Chief Justice HG Ramesh and Justice PS Dinesh Kumar asked the Siddaramaiah government to take appropriate steps to prevent a breakdown of law and order on that date. The same pro-Kannada organisations had called for a shutdown on 25 January during Shah's visit to the state. The protesters will instead observe a ""black day"" on Sunday. The bandh was called to protest the ""inaction"" by the central and state governments to resolve the Mahadayi river water sharing row. The high court bench observed that the bandh calls given by Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha on 25 January and 4 February ""violate(s) the democratic rights of citizens"". Meanwhile, the Congress-led state government in Karnataka dismissed allegations of batting for the bandh during the prime minister's visit.

DMK Working President MK Stalin said that constitutional institutions and principles are under threat. He added that the governor's decision to invite the BJP to form the government is ""arbitrary"" and ""unconstitutional,” and that it will only encourage horse trading and “destroy our democratic foundations.” He later told ANI that PM Modi misused the governor’s office in Tamil Nadu and has done the same in Karnataka, and that it is against democracy and rule of law.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje took to twitter to defend her party, saying the BJP is the choice of Karnataka. She congratulated new CM BS Yeddyurappa and the people of Karnataka.

" Top NDA leaders in Bihar on Thursday attended a grand feast hosted in Patna by the BJP on completion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's four years in power. They asserted that the coalition would continue its winning streak in the Lok Sabha polls due next year, even as alliance partner  . Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan and Radha Mohan Singh, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and BJP's national general secretary in-charge of Bihar Bhupendra Yadav were prominent among those who attended the get-together. The meeting happened to be the first such function held after the return of Kumar who is also the JD(U) national president to the BJP-led coalition a year earlier. Speculations were rife that matters relating to sharing of seats in the general elections would be discussed at the function, which lasted for almost two hours. However, most leaders left the venue after having dinner, without speaking to the media or addressing functionaries of the various parties which constitute the NDA in the state. The NDA in Bihar comprises, besides JD(U) and BJP, the Lok Janshakti Party headed by Paswan and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party of Union minister Upendra Kushwaha who skipped the meeting. Paswan's son and LJP parliamentary board chief Chirag Paswan said, ""With today's function, we have made a great beginning. That we all stand solidly together was evident and soon we shall be looking forward to chalking out of our strategy for Lok Sabha polls."" He also sought to downplay Kushwaha's surprise decision to stay away from the gathering, saying all issues, including sharing of seats, would be amicably settled in due course. State health minister and former Bihar BJP chief Mangal Pandey said not much should be read into the absence of Kushwaha who could not come because of unavoidable circumstances. ""Please note that his party was duly represented here. The opposition will be severely disappointed, and even worried, by this show of solidarity,"" he said. Union minister and BJP leader Ram Kripal Yadav also said all is well in the NDA.

""Kushwahas have a large population. Nitish Kumar has a distinct disadvantage on this count. The NDA should pay heed to our suggestion,"" Nagamani said. Both Kushwaha and Nagamani happen to be former associates of Kumar but both of them fell out with the Bihar chief minister at different points of time.

" Anubhav Mishra  Mohd Ibrahim A day after the Reserve Bank of India, in its annual report, announced that over 99 percent of the demonetised currency had made its way back into the banks, Congress President Rahul Gandhi addressed the media on Thursday, 30 August, hitting out at the Narendra Modi government. He further alleged that demonetisation was an attack on the general public, and was intended to help only the rich. “  is nothing less than a huge scam,” Gandhi said. Interestingly, Gandhi began his press conference with a question directed at the media persons gathered – regarding their safety and freedom. “Are you writing freely these days, or is there some pressure?”, he asked. He also attacked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley – over his counter-questions on the Rafale deal. Reiterating his demand for a joint parliamentary committee on the Rafale deal allegations, Gandhi took a jibe at Jaitley’s Facebook post, where the latter had posed questions at the UPA government’s deal on the Rafale jets. Then quoting a joint statement on the deal, allegedly issued by the governments of France and India, Gandhi said PM Modi was “lying”. The Congress president also alleged that the NPAs had grown under the NDA government’s regime to Rs 12.5 lakh, as compared to the previous UPA regime’s Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Lashing out at the prime minister’s electoral promises, Gandhi said: Minutes after Gandhi’s press conference, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley lashed out the Congress President, stating that the Rafale deal was “20 percent cheaper” under the NDA government than the UPA. Taking to Twitter, Jaitley said: Gandhi at the press conference had maintained that the BJP was attempting to buy the Rafale jets at at a price three times more than the UPA government’s deal. To this, Jaitley said: Finally, on Gandhi’s allegation that demonetisation was Modi’s tactic to please his “crony capitalist friends”, Jaitley said: Lashing out Rahul Gandhi, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra questioned if “reform” was “deform” for the Gandhi scion. Taking a jibe at him, Patra said that Gandhi had nothing new to talk about, apart from the Rafale deal. Further questioning how the demonetised money could be called black money, Patra said: The central bank, in its annual report, said almost all of the demonetised currency notes have been counted and accounted for by it. According to the report, Rs 15.31 lakh crore worth currency notes have now been returned, since 8 November 2016. This represents about 99.3 percent of the total currency notes which went out of circulation on a single day. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominated currency notes, the total value of these high value currency notes in circulation was Rs 15.41 lakh crore.

" The Opposition Congress and NCP on Tuesday withdrew their notice of no-confidence against Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde. The notice was listed in Tuesday's agenda for the Lower House. The names of 38 opposition members, from the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), were mentioned in the one-line resolution, which said that the speaker be removed from his post. However, as the no-confidence notice came up for consideration before the House, Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil stood up and said the issue was discussed among the opposition leaders, and that they decided against pressing for adoption of the one-line resolution. The Congress legislator further said that the no-confidence notice against the speaker was being withdrawn. The opposition parties had given a notice of no-confidence against the speaker on 5 March, alleging that he was biased in conducting proceedings of the House. They had also criticised him for the passage of the motion of thanks on Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao's address without any debate, thus allowing the government ""to run away from debate"". Last week, the opposition members had demanded that the notice of no-confidence be admitted and taken up for discussion in the House. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had later told the members that appropriate decision would be taken on it after consultations. However, on 23 March, Fadnavis moved a motion of confidence in the Chair, which the House had passed with a voice vote. The sudden development had left the Opposition parties stumped as they did not get a chance to speak on it. The chief minister on Monday justified his action of getting a trust motion passed in favour Bagde when a no-confidence notice against the latter was pending. Citing a ""precedent"" during the Congress-NCP rule, he said, ""In 2006, the then chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh got a trust vote in favour of his Council of Ministers passed in the House without a prior notice and listing of the issue on the day's agenda."" ""When you didn't find anything objectionable then, why are you opposing it now?"" Fadnavis asked the opposition members in the House. He said there was no difference between an Assembly speaker and a chief minister (in terms of moving no-trust motion). The ongoing budget session of the state Legislature would end on Wednesday.",PTI

""Non-inclusion has deprived them of benefits of various government facilities and jobs,"" Ering had told the Union minister. The MP has been demanding ST status for the five tribes since 2016.

"The Maharashtra government has decided to stand guarantor for loans to be disbursed to youth from the Maratha community under a scheme to extend financial assistance to backward communities. The decision was taken at the cabinet sub-committee chaired by revenue minister Chandrakant Patil yesterday. The committee has been set up to take steps for the welfare of the Maratha community, which has been agitating over its demand for reservation in government jobs and education. The panel had received complaints that banks were not approving loans of people from the community and asking for counter-guarantee. Over 10,000 applications are pending for approval and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had earlier given an assurance that he will take up the issue with the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC). During the meeting yesterday, the cabinet sub-committee decided that the government would stand guarantor for loans to be given to the Maratha youth under a scheme of the state-run Annabhau Sathe Financial Development Corporation, said an official release issued late last night. The scheme aims to improve the financial condition of backward communities by offering assistance for self-employment and other business ventures. The MPhil and PhD research students from the community will also be given fellowships by the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaja Research, Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI), set up by the government in Pune. The institute’s mandate is to study social, financial and educational issues faced by Marathas, Kunbis and farmers in the state. Patil said the government has decided to pay half of the fees of students including Marathas, whose family income is less than Rs 8 lakh per anum, for 608 professional courses. Action would be taken against colleges which do not admit students by taking 50% fees (as part of the fee-waiver scheme), he said. A coaching centre to help the community students prepare for competitive exams will be set up in Pune. The government will pay fees of students who seek guidance and training in other institutes, the cabinet sub-committee decided. Fadnavis had said last week that a special session of the Maharashtra legislature would be convened to pass “a law or a resolution” for reservation to the Marathas. He had appealed for peace in the state, rocked by violent protests over the quota issue and announced withdrawal of certain cases against members of the community. The politically influential Maratha community, constituting around 30% of the state’s population, has been demanding 16% reservation in government jobs and education. The community had earlier taken out silent marches across the state to highlight their demands, prominently for reservation. However, their latest round of agitation has taken a violent turn.",PTI
"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on 11 February said that his organisation has the capacity to form an army within a few days to fight for the country. Bhagwat’s comments made at a gathering of RSS workers in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, came under attack from the opposition parties. The Opposition on 12 February lashed out at RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's remarks on the Army, demanding that he apologise to the nation. There was also a demand for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clarify if he was in favour of a ""private militia"" guarding India's borders. The parties charged Bhagwat with ""insulting"" the armed forces and the country for the said remarks. Reacting to the statement, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that Bhagwat’s comment was an “insult to every Indian, our flag and every soldier who saluted it.” He added that that it was “shameful” of Bhagwat to “disrespect” the army and demanded that the RSS apologise for it. Congress's senior spokesperson Anand Sharma said the RSS chief's statement insulted the Indian armed forces and called for a clarification from Modi over this. Kerala Chief Minister and CPI-M leader Pinarayi Vijayan slammed Bhagwat, alleging that the RSS wanted to ""turn India into Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany"". There was equal outrage over Union Minister’s tweet supporting Bhagwat’s remarks. Rijiju, in his tweet, said, “Bhagwat ji only said it takes 6-7 months for a person to be a trained soldier & if Constitution permits RSS cadres has the ability to contribute.” The Trinamool Congress attacked Bhagwat as well as Kiren Rijiju for defending the RSS chief, alleging that it had become ""even more evident"" that the government was being ""remote-controlled"" by the Sangh. Referring to Bhagwat's remarks and the incident in Kolkata where DG BSF K K Sharma had, in uniform, reportedly attended a conference on border security conducted by an RSS- affiliated organisation, the TMC said every constitutional institution was being ""marginalised"". The Sharad Pawar-led NCP also sought an apology from the RSS, saying Bhagwat’s remarks were an insult to India’s armed forces. RSS Prachaar Pramukh Dr Manmohan Vaidya, in a statement, said that the Bhagwat’s comments were being misinterpreted, and that RSS workers would also be a part of the Indian Army. People took to Twitter to condemn the RSS chief for “belittling” Indian Army’s preparedness and raised questions on the Sangh’s history. Meanwhile, VHP international working president Pravin Togadia said on Sunday that the army should be given a ""free hand"" to deal with those fomenting trouble in the Kashmir Valley. He was speaking at a gathering of VHP workers in Chandigarh. Referring to 1971 Indo-Pak war, Togadia praised the then prime minister Indira Gandhi's bold leadership. ""I have said it is time to fight a war against Pakistan. If Indira Gandhi could bifurcate Pakistan into two then and take more than 90,000 Pakistani soldiers as prisoners of war, now it is time to break Pakistan into five parts and capture one lakh Pakistani soldiers,” Togadia said. When asked to comment on a senior lawmaker of the National Conference (NC) raising pro-Pakistan slogans in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Togadia said, ""He should be arrested and courts should hang him so that in future no one dares to raise pro-Pakistan slogans in this country.” “Mehbooba government should be dismissed as it orders FIRs against our soldiers. We do not want such a government. I also want to ask what is the compulsion (of the coalition partner BJP) to support this (PDP led) government,” he said.

"The 2008 Malegaon blasts ensured that “saffron terror” would be added to the Indian political lexicon. While there was quite a political furore over the naming of former ABVP and RSS functionaries in the chargesheet, it was all but ignored that a serving Army officer, namely, Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Prasad Purohit, had also been allegedly involved.Two bomb blasts took place, almost simultaneously, in Maharashtra and Gujarat, on 29 September 2008.  In the former state, two low intensity bombs, fitted on a Hero Honda motorcycle and rigged to detonate in Malegaon.On 29 September 2008, two low-intensity bombs fitted in a Hero Honda motorcycle exploded, killing four people and injuring 79 others in Malegaon, a city in Maharashtra’s Nashik district. Almost simultaneously, another blast was triggered in Modasa, Gujarat, where a 15-year-old boy lost his life. The blasts occurred on the eve of Navratri. The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) began an investigation into the Malegaon blast, led by then ATS Chief Hemant Karkare, who was later killed in the 26/11 Mumbai terror strike. The ATS got its first breakthrough in the case by tracing the owner of the motorcycle used in the blast. The links from the owner of the motorcycle led to the arrest of three accused on 24 October 2008. The ATS arrested Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, Shiv Narayan Gopal Singh Kalsanghra, and Shyam Bhawarlal Sahu. The investigation also found links to Hindu extremist groups like the Abhinav Bharat, Rastriya Jagran Manch, Sharda Sarvagya Peeth, and the Hindu Rashtra Sena. All of the accused arrested or named in the chargesheet belonged to either of these organisations. The ATS probe also found links to these groups with respect to the 2006 Malegaon bomb blast, the Ajmer Dargah blast, the Mecca Masjid and the Samjhauta Train blast. This led to the prosecution filing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA), which necessitates that the court should take cognizance of two former chargesheets against one or more of the accused. By the time the ATS arrested Lt Col Prasad Shrikant Purohit, a serving Army officer, on 4 November 2008, for his alleged involvement in the blasts, the case had been heavily politicised – the BJP and the Shiv Sena accused the Congress of ‘using’ the ATS for its own political motives. This is how the case developed over the past decade, as per a   report: 4 November 2008: The Maharashtra ATS arrest Lt Col Shrikant Purohit, a serving Army officer, for his alleged involvement in the September 2008 Malegaon blasts. The accused were subsequently booked under the MCOCA. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint

": Blaming the Congress for the impasse in Parliament's Budget Session, BJP president Amit Shah said on Thursday that the opposition party has proved that its's priority is ""politics of disruption and instability"" and not people's welfare.

""The way the Congress vitiated the atmosphere in the Budget Session's second phase and disrupted it, people in a democracy will not forgive it.

The prosecution had earlier moved an application before the court seeking extension on the ground that sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) have been applied in the case. Under the IPC, a charge-sheet has to be filed within 90 days of arrest of an accused. But under the UAPA, an extension of 90 days can be obtained from the court. Public prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar, while seeking extension for filing the supplementary charge sheet, argued that the accused were were not interrogated when they were under house arrest. She said the investigating officer, ACP Shivaji Pawar, was busy handling the case in the district court, then in the Bombay high court and the Supreme Court. Hence, he needs more time to investigate the case which is of serious nature, the public prosecutor said. She said the police have recovered vast amount of electronic data during the probe and intercepted coded communication between one of the accused with Maoist cadre. All these need forensic examination and enforcement agencies will take some time to analyse those, she said. Defence lawyers opposed the extension plea, asking what had stopped police to interrogate the accused while they were in their custody. After hearing both sides, Judge Vadane accepted the police plea. According to police, Maoists had backed the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31 last year. The provocative speeches made at the gathering allegedly led to violence at Koregaon Bhima in Pune district the next day.",PTI
" BJP MP Poonam Mahajan on Monday said farmers and tribals protesting in Maharashtra were being misguided by ""urban Maoists"". The remarks drew flak from the CPM, NCP and AAP, whose leaders targeted the BJP MP for the ""insensitive"" remarks. The MP from Mumbai North Central said it was the responsibility of the BJP-led Maharashtra government to sit with the protesters, who were being ""captured"" by Maoists, to solve their problems. ""Sadly, tribals have been captured by the Maoists and their centre is in Pune. The government can do a lot for them, but the (Maoists') ideology is stopping them."" ""We have seen urban Maoists in many cities of India. They go to districts which are called Maoists affected areas,"" Mahajan told reporters outside Parliament. ""Maoists are misguiding them (the farmers). It is the responsibility of the Maharashtra government to sit with the farmers and sort out the problem,"" she said as Mumbai's Azad Maidan turned into a sea of red on Monday morning with thousands of farmers carrying red flags converging after walking around 180 km from neighbouring Nashik district for six days. The farmers, who banded together under the Left-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), reached Mumbai last afternoon and called off their protest this evening after the BJP-led government in Maharashtra accepted their demands. The main demand on the farmers' list includes an unconditional loan waiver and transfer of forest land to tribal farmers who have been tilling it for years. Hitting out at Mahajan, CPM leader MB Rajesh said, ""The Kisan Sabha is leading the rally. One can see the posters, banners and flags. I am scared the BJP may also call them anti-nationals."" NCP leader Supriya Sule also lambasted Mahajan over the remarks, asking the BJP MP not to belittle the farmers. ""The blood which comes out of the foot after a thorn is embedded is not Maoist just because it is red. There is no politics attached to the toil and sweat of farmers. This was a morcha of those who toil hard. I condemn those who call people struggling for their just demands as Maoists,"" Sule tweeted. AAP spokesperson Preeti Sharma Menon tweeted: ""What arrogance! Poonam Mahajan dismisses protesting farmers as Maoists.""",PTI
"After leading from the front in the Gujarat Assembly polls that saw his party improving its show, Congress president Rahul Gandhi is now focusing on Uttar Pradesh to galvanise party cadres in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections. First time after donning the mantle of the party chief, Gandhi is all set to pay a two-day visit to his Lok Sabha constituency Amethi from Monday. Though party workers are excited by his anointment and have planned a grand reception in Amethi, they are aware that the path for their young leader will not be easy in Uttar Pradesh where its electoral foray in the assembly polls had been anything but encouraging.

The Uttar Pradesh Assembly has 403 seats. In the last assembly elections, the Congress managed to win just seven seats, its lowest ever in the state. But what came as a bigger shock was its dismal show in Amethi and Rae Bareli, which had long been nurtured by the Gandhi family. The Modi wave stormed into Amethi and Rae Bareli, and Congress was routed in eight of the 10 Assembly seats there. The BJP won six seats in Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi's parliamentary constituencies with two seats going to the Samajwadi Party.

"Demanding that an independent special investigation team (SIT) be formed to probe the death of special CBI judge BH Loya, the Congress on Wednesday, 31 January, slammed the judicial system for “safeguarding the interests of some people,” at a press conference at the party headquarters in New Delhi.

" Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will present the Congress-JDS coalition government's maiden budget on Thursday, amid high expectations of farm loan waiver. In the run-up to the recent Assembly polls, the Kumaraswamy-led JD(S) had promised to waive farm loans borrowed both from cooperative and nationalised banks within 24 hours of coming to power. Kumaraswamy, who also holds the finance portfolio, had earlier cited coalition compulsions and the need for studying the financial condition of the state as the reason for the delay in the announcement of loan waiver. Financial experts and some government officials have already expressed concern over the impact loan waiver may have on the state's finances. It will also be interesting to see how Kumaraswamy, who has in the past claimed that he is not an expert on the economy, will strike a balance between loan waiver, flagship schemes of the previous government, new schemes or programmes if any, as also infrastructure needs of the state. The Congress-JD(S) coordination committee constituted to oversee the smooth functioning of the government had on Sunday approved the Common Minimum Programme, which includes waiver of farm loans, the creation of one crore jobs and allocation of Rs 1.25 lakh crore for irrigation over the next five years. It also included construction of 20 lakh houses for homeless families in the state in the next five years, along with the implementation of a universal health policy, 'Arogya Karnataka' of the previous government, among others. The budget also comes amid coalition worries and debate over whether there was a need for a full-fledged fresh budget as the government would continue almost all the flagship schemes of the previous government. Former chief minister and Coordination committee chief Siddaramaiah, who held the finance portfolio in the previous government, had recently said there was no need for a fresh budget and insisted that a supplementary budget would do. Adding to the coalition's discomfort is the controversy over videos that purportedly showed coordination committee chairman Siddaramaiah's remarks, questioning the need for a fresh budget and expressing scepticism over the longevity of the government. On the other hand, the opposition BJP has demanded that Kumaraswamy come out with a ""white paper"" on the state's financial position before presenting the budget. Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly BS Yeddyurappa has warned that if the government fails to keep up its promises on loan waiver, BJP and all its 104 MLAs would go to the people with the Congress and JD(S) manifestos to inform them that the parties have not 'walked the talk.' Meanwhile, Karnataka Legislative Assembly Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar on Wednesday sounded a note of caution about loan waiver becoming a ""fashion"". Taking note of the discussions regarding farm loan waiver, he questioned why no one was talking about making farmer capable of paying back. Stating that it is true that loan waiver was needed to relieve farmers in distress, Kumar said ""but let loan waiver not become a fashion."" In what is being seen as an effort by Congress to claim its share of credit for the farm loan waiver, keeping in mind the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, party President Rahul Gandhi today expressed confidence about the Congress-JDS coalition government acting on its commitment to waive farmer loans and to make farming more profitable. ""On the eve of the Karnataka Budget, I'm confident our Congress-JDS coalition Govt will act on our commitment to waive farmer loans & to make farming more profitable,"" he said in a tweet. ""This budget is an opportunity for our Govt. to make Karnataka a beacon of hope for farmers all across India,"" he said.",Press Trust of India

"The war of words between the BJP and the Congress has intensified ahead of the 28 November polling in Madhya Pradesh with both parties raising a range of issues to attack each other. While the Congress accused the BJP of raking up the issues of Pakistan and Ram temple to ward off an impending electoral defeat, the ruling party said the main opposition outfit is feeling like a ""fish out of water"" since it lost power in Madhya Pradesh 15 years ago. Talking to reporters in Indore on Friday, Congress national spokesperson Shakeel Ahmad said the BJP starts taking the name of Pakistan whenever it senses defeat in elections. It also starts doing politics in the name of Lord Rama when elections are just around the corner, he said. Asked about the Congress' stand on the Ram temple issue, he said, ""This matter is being heard at the Supreme Court. We will surely react if Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes any statement about the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya."" The Congress leader said, ""If the BJP government at the Centre wants to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya then why is it not bringing an ordinance? This government is only trying to deceive people in the name of Lord Rama."" Ahmad said India's key defence needs were ignored in the controversial Rafale deal.

" Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal will address a rally at the birthplace of Jijabai, mother of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, in Maharashtra on Friday. Kejriwal will address the rally at Sindkhed Raja in Buldhana district, and pay tributes on her birth anniversary, 
party sources said. Every year, lakhs of people, mostly from the politically dominant Maratha community, gather at the place to pay their respects to Rajmata (King's mother) Jijabai. Police had initially denied permission for the rally citing law and order issues, but the rally, slated on Friday morning, will be held as planned after AAP leaders took up this issue with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and senior police officials, the sources said. After the permission was granted, Kejriwal had tweeted in Marathi, saying ""On the occasion of   on 12 January, I am coming to Sindkhed Raja to have a dialogue with the people of Maharashtra."" Marathas, who comprise of approximately 32 percent of the state's population, had taken to the streets last year, 
demanding reservations in education and job sectors. The choice of the venue also underlines the agenda of the party, particularly in the backdrop of the recent turmoil in Maharashtra, where Marathas were pitted against Dalits 
after the Bhima-Koregaon violence. Kejriwal is expected to induct Brigadier (retd.) Sudhir Sawant, a former Congress MP from Konkan region, into the AAP, at the rally on Friday AAP spokesperson Preeti Sharma Menon said. Sawant is a Maratha. However, the AAP spokesperson said her party does not believe in wooing the Maratha community or any other

"Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal and three of his ministers have been on a sit-in protest at the office of Lietenant-Governor of Delhi Anil Baijal for the past week, but it was on Sunday that the movement saw the most momentum — the chief ministers of four states came out in support of the Aam Aadmi Party’s protest, urging both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh to intervene and resolve the crisis. Buoyed by their backing, AAP   from Mandi House to the prime minister’s official home. Thousands of supporters participated in the demonstration, but the Delhi Police stopped their progress at Parliament Street — they did not have permission to hold the rally — and AAP soon called off the protest for the day. The unprecedented situation in Delhi began with the AAP leaders accusing Indian Administrative (IAS) officers of being on strike for months, since the alleged assault on chief secretary Anshu Prakash in February. The Kejriwal government claimed that IAS officers had not been attending meetings called by ministers in protest against the alleged assault, which had stalled schemes for the public. In their protest, the chief minister and his colleagues have been demanding that Baijal meet them and order the IAS officers to return to work. Of all the political leaders who have voiced their support for the AAP dharna so far, Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee has been the most articulate in its criticism of the crisis in Delhi. Ever an avid BJP critic,   on Saturday night, along with the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala, to demand an end to the turmoil in the Delhi government and highlight   with its strong-arm politics. Such was the reaction to her support for Kejriwal and his dharna that the Congress was compelled to reach out to her. Believed to be at the behest of former party president Sonia Gandhi, Congress leader  . It was likely that they discussed the current state of federalism in India and what could be done to protect it from the risks it faces from the ruling saffron party. The meeting was arranged even though the  . Senior leader and former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit called the protest at the L-G’s office an ""excuse"" to avoid work. Calling it ""completely unacceptable"", she said, ""The people of Delhi are very disappointed because they brought him (to power) with a huge majority, and this is how he is treating them."" It would be significant to note the stark difference of opinion between the Congress and its ally in Karnataka, the Janata Dal (Secular), which is led by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy. Kumaraswamy had joined Banerjee at the press conference on Saturday to show his support for AAP’s cause. In its power tussle with the lieutenant governor and the BJP, Kejriwal and his government has garnered the backing of several regional parties, even as the L-G’s office continues to stay mum on the crisis. Working president of the DMK MK Stalin   what many are sure to have been thinking the past week: ""I am concerned with the disdain shown by Lt. Gov. of Delhi towards an elected Chief Minister like @ArvindKejriwal. The BJP is proactively destroying the federal structure of this nation.” AAP has been at loggerheads with the two L-Gs Delhi has had since the party came to power. It has always maintained that the BJP uses the administrative head as a tool to hamper development in the national capital and thwart the Delhi government’s work. On Monday, Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) — a member of the BJP-led ruling National Democratic Alliance — became the latest to join the Kejriwal bandwagon. He said that those backing the IAS officers’ strike “can reap political benefits” and also warned of how such immediate political benefits would harm democracy. Rebel senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha went a step further to extend his support to Kejriwal.  , he wrote that the BJP was still “punishing” AAP for “comprehensively defeating” the saffron party in the Delhi Assembly elections in 2015. He pointed out the flaws of a diarchical system of governance, adding a jibe that Atal Bihari Vajpayee would have handled the defeat “more maturely”. With his usual usual twinge of sarcasm, National Conference working president  : “Forget the arguments and counterarguments, a CM elected by the people of Delhi with an overwhelming majority is protesting in the lt governor’s residence for the last six days & the powers that be couldn’t seem to care less. Democracy anyone?” Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, who never hesitates to criticise his ally in Maharashtra,   and said: ""In a democracy like ours, all elected governments should have a free hand to run the state. After all, they have been elected on the people's mandate. They have popular support. That has to be respected."" Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said the situation in Delhi was ""worse than the murder of democracy"", and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav alleged that the BJP was taking ""revenge on the people of Delhi"" for not voting it to power in the capital in the last two decades. Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), not only expressed his support for AAP, but also   in Delhi on Sunday. He accused the BJP of “using the office of governors and L-Gs” to “destabilise non-BJP democratically-elected state governments”, giving the examples of Goa, Manipur, Meghalaya and Puducherry. Regional parties Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) also voiced their support for the AAP dharna at the L-G’s office. JMM working president and former chief minister Hemant Soren  : ""I salute the fight by Delhi for its rights. The AAP government in Delhi is forced to take to the street for its rights. What kind of democracy is it? Jharkhand is with the people of Delhi and with Kejriwal."" TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu — who was one of the four chief ministers who held an unprecedented press conference in AAP’s support on Saturday night — said that the ""trend of using the governor's office for political benefits of the ruling party at the Centre goes against the spirit of the Constitution"". “Interference in the functioning of an elected government is unacceptable in a democracy,”  . “In fact, what is happening in Delhi and in TN/Pondicherry is not too different. It is frustrating for people who want a change for the better.” “Shotgun” Shatrughan Sinha, who has developed a reputation of being a BJP rebel,  : “Our dear friend, dynamic & most-talked-about Chief Minister of Delhi @ArvindKejriwal has certainly shown statesmanship and has appealed the officers to get back to work. He has moved two steps. Hope the so-called strike of the bureaucrats ends now. Jai Hind!” He also   that the prime minister would intervene to ensure an end to the IAS officers’ strike “It will be a good step by him for the people of Delhi and democracy at large. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,” he added. On the L-G’s refusal to meet the four chief ministers he said: “This kind of blatant show of autocracy, despotism, autarchy and use of power...will only ridicule our party’s image and give them tremendous sympathy of their followers. Just think about it and take it as ‘food for thought’ — consider the genuine demand of Arvind Kejriwal."" Actor Prakash Raj, too,   for Kejriwal and made a jibe at Modi in the same vein. “Dear supreme leader… We know you are busy with Fitbit challenge, yoga and EXERCISE, can you spare a minute and take a deep breath, look around, and instruct bureaucrats to work with Chief Minister Kejriwal...(who is actually doing a good job) and EXERCISE your duty too.” Unsurprisingly, the BJP has been spewing venom at Kejriwal and his party since they began their protest at the L-G’s office on 11 June. Two days after the dharna began, BJP leaders and AAP rebel leader Kapil Mishra mimicked their protest and sat on a dharna at Kejriwal's office against the ""non-performance"" of his government. ""You have done everything in your power to shrug off any responsibility that comes with the position you hold, we are writing to you with a hope that you would have your conscience awakened to your moral responsibility,”  . BJP MP Subramanian Swamy even went to extent of calling the Delhi chief minister a “born Naxalite”. He said: “He has nothing, he is all evaporated...This man is a Naxalite, he is a born Naxalite, he has been always hidden naxalite.” Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Monday said the AAP dharna was “destroying the trust the people of Delhi had put in them”. “'  zero,   hero (AAP shows no results with its work, but is at the best at agitations,” he added. While the BJP continued to trivialise the AAP protest, IAS officers held a press conference to   to begin with. The IAS Officers' Association dismissed the allegation that they had not been working. ""We all had various experiences of assault. We will not attend a meeting if we are not feeling safe. We have gone out of the way to ensure that public do not suffer, their work does not suffer, but we will not work at the cost of our life. IAS Association secretary Manisha Saxena — a divisional commissioner and secretary of arts, culture and languages — said they “don't feel safe” and “need a culture of trust to work"". In response, Kejriwal assured them that he would do everything in his power to protect them. Baijal’s refusal to give them time even once in the past week has led many to question his dedication to work in the interest of the residents of Delhi, and unless forcibly removed, it seems unlikely that the AAP leaders will end their dharna anytime soon. With neither the lieutenant-governor nor the prime minister speaking up on the crisis in the National Capital, and now with the   in the political tussle, it’s hard to tell which way the protest will head.",FP Staff

" Women and child development minister Maneka Gandhi on Monday said she has asked the law ministry to not keep any age limit to report child sexual abuse, allowing people to complain about what has happened to them even “10-15 years later”. Noting that anger at molestation and sexual abuse never goes away, Gandhi also said she is “very happy” that the #MeToo campaign has started in India and encouraged women to come forward to complain against sexual harassment. “One always remembers the person who molested them and we have written to the law ministry that one should be allowed to complain without any time limit,” Gandhi told reporters. Under Section 468 of the CrPC, any offence, including child abuse, which can lead to a prison term of three years has to be reported within three years of the incident. According to Section 473 of the CrPC, a court may take cognisance of an older case if it is in the “interest of justice” or if the “delay has been properly explained”. However, victims of child sexual abuse often face problems in registering an FIR once they are 18 or more. Maneka Gandhi said she has proposed that people can complain even “10-15 years later”. “It doesn’t matter how much later. If you’re going to complain the avenue is open,” she added. Gandhi had earlier proposed that child sexual abuse victims be allowed to register complaints until they are 30. Discussing the #MeToo movement, the minister warned that it should not be used to “target people who have offended us in some way”. “I hope it does not go out of control in a way that we target people who have offended us in some way but I think women are angry at sexual molestation,” she added. Gandhi had earlier expressed her support for actor Tanushree Dutta, who has levelled allegations of sexual misconduct against Nana Patekar during the shoot of a film ten years ago. She had said harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Citing Harvey Weinstein, she had said last Tuesday that when the first victim came out and reported against the Hollywood film producer, people asked her all kinds of questions, including why she took so long to speak out. “But I know when your body is abused, you remember it always. I don’t care when the complaint is filed but action should be taken,” Gandhi said last week.",PTI

": Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar Tuesday said if the central government was ""effective"", there would not have been bribery charges at the highest level in the CBI, and asked prime minister Narendra Modi to act over the matter. He also attacked the BJP-led Centre over the Rafale jet deal and demanded a probe into it by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC). Pawar was replying to queries during an interaction at the ""Mumbai Manthan"" conclave organised by television news channel Aaj Tak. The feud between Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Director Alok Verma and his deputy Rakesh Asthana turned murkier with the arrest of a deputy superintendent of police in the Special Investigation Team headed by Asthana over bribery charges. Asked about the Modi government's performance, Pawar said people's expectations from the present dispensation were not fulfilled. ""What was promised in 2014 is not seen on the ground after four years. (Former prime minister) Manmohan Singh tried his best to give a good government, intentions were best. That is not the situation today. ""If the present government was effective, there would not have been bribery charges at the highest level in the CBI. Still the prime minister is silent. He should act,"" the former Union minister said. Pawar said Modi was a strong leader for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but not the country. ""His ministerial team does not have the capacity to deliver. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is the most powerful. All decisions are taken there and the files are sent to the ministers to sign. The present government does only 'man ki baat' and does not listen to 'jan ki baat' (people's voice),"" he added. Firing a fresh salvo over the Rafale fighter jet deal, Pawar said the Centre should clarify why the price of one aircraft increased from Rs 570 crore to Rs 1,600 crore. ""There is room for suspicion. So there should be a JPC probe. If the BJP stalled Parliament for three weeks for a JPC probe in (the) Bofors (case), why should the BJP, now in power, oppose a JPC?,"" he asked. Asked if he felt there was corruption in the Rafale deal as alleged by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Pawar said he had no information about it. ""I only know the aircraft is good. Rahul Gandhi may have more information than me about corruption,"" he said.

"Former Chief Justice of India TS Thakur on Saturday spoke out against the controversial 12 January press conference held by four senior judges of the Supreme Court, saying they ""need not look for outside help for resolving their institutional problems"". Justice Thakur was referring to the presser by four senior judges – Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, MB Lokur and Kurian Joseph – who had virtually raised revolt against Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra by levelling litany of allegations against him. The former CJI, who dubbed the presser as a ""disturbing"" event, said that the issues brought into public domain in the press conference gave the media and the politicians an opportunity to discuss matter which ""ought to have been addressed and solved within the confines of the Supreme Court"". ""No political party or media house or politician can be accused of indiscretion when judges of the Supreme Court make a public statement that democracy in the country is in danger,"" he said. Justice Thakur said that when judges want the nation to decide issues, which they can and ought to decide themselves, anyone witnessing it would feel disturbed by the development that the highest judiciary was unable to decide issues concerning its working and was taking it to the public at large. Justice Thakur was speaking on the topic of 'Independence of Judiciary' at an event organised by an NGO, Global Jurists, founded by former Delhi High Court judge Kailash Gambhir who also expressed similar views about the 12 January presser. ""An appeal to the nation is not what would have helped the judges. I firmly believe that judges need not look for outside help for resolving their institutional problems. There is a tremendous reservoir of talent in the Supreme Court which can and ought to be used for finding solutions. Judges have to look within and not without for guidance,"" he said. He further said: The remarks by Thakur came a day after Justice Chelameswar shared the dias with CJI Misra on the last working day of the apex court. The Supreme Court has gone on a summer break and Justice Chelameswar will retire during the vacation on 22 June. It is a custom in the apex court that a judge on the last working day before retirement shares the dias with the CJI. Justice Gambhir, who also spoke at the event, referred to the stalled elevation of Uttarakhand Chief Justice K M Joseph to the apex court and said that instead of the ""internal bickerings"", the collegium ought to have sent the file back to the government immediately. He said that the independence of the judiciary was threatened not only by the political executive, but also from within itself. He also termed as shocking the row between the CJI on one side and the four senior most judges on the other. Apart from him, the other speakers included former Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Vijender Jain, former veteran scribe H K Dua and former Law Commission Member Mool Chand Sharma who said that the recent attempt to impeach CJI Misra by the Congress was a ""political tool to threaten and scare"" the judiciary as the party did not have the numbers to support their move.

": The Samajwadi Party on Monday accused prime minister Narendra Modi of ""diverting"" people's attention from ""rising"" cases of rape and crime against women across the country. ""Not even Sambhal, cases of crime against women and rape are rising steadily across India. The prime minister is trying to divert the attention of the people,"" SP general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav told reporters in Delhi. He was responding to a question on the alleged gangrape of a woman in Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh. The SP leader, however, did not elaborate on how the PM was trying to divert the attention of the people. The party had convened a press conference to be addressed by SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav at his residence. Mulayam, however, did not attend the conference and instead his cousin Ram Gopal addressed the media on issues related to the Ram Manohar Lohia trust. The meeting of its trustees was held here today.

" Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a swipe at the Modi government after the Economic Survey was released, saying ' ' are here, except for ""minor hiccups"" such as a decrease in the growth of GDP, agriculture and job creation. Shedding the impact of the GST and demonetisation, India's economy is ""picking up quite nicely"", and will expand by 7-7.5 percent in 2018-19 to again become the world's fastest-growing major economy, the Economic Survey released on Monday said. Reacting to the survey, former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram hit out at the government over the ""depressing"" report and predicted a growth rate of 6-6.5 percent for 2017-18. In a jibe at the government, Gandhi tweeted, ""The Economic Survey 2018 says, 'Acche Din' are here, except for these minor hiccups: Industrial Growth is (down). Agricultural Growth is (down). GDP Growth is (down) and Job Growth is (down). Don't worry Be Happy!"" He also tagged a video of the song ""Don't worry be happy"" with the tweet. Chidambaram said though the survey says growth rate for 2017-18 will be 6.75 percent, implying a second-half growth rate of 7.5 percent, it offers little evidence in support of this claim. ""The growth rate in the first half was 6 percent, and the year is likely to end with a growth rate of between 6 and 6.5 percent....Altogether, it is a depressing report of the fiscal year that will come to an end in two months,"" he said. Agriculture is India's lifeline and the Economic Survey recognises that, but ""causing 'agrarian distress' has become the designed objective of the Modi government"", he said. ""With another year to go for the general elections, even if the agriculture-GDP growth jumps to 4 percent in 2018-19, the five-year average will still be 2.3 percent, the lowest since the economic reforms began,"" the former finance minister said. He also said the agriculture-GDP growth under the Modi government has plunged to just 1.9 percent, half of what was achieved in the first four years of the UPA. ""Reason is deliberate betrayal of India's farmers by PM on the promise of cost plus 50 percent of MSP,"" he said. Congress's communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said, ""All in all it has turned out to be 'much ado without direction, cohesion and vision'!"" ""With one year to go for next general elections, prime minister Modi has plunged the 'state of India's economy' towards despondency, dejection and dire straits,"" he alleged. He said that 'Modinomics' had 'decoupled' India's robust economy by ""myopic vision and the double whammy of demonetisation and ill-conceived GST"". Surjewala alleged that the Economic Survey establishes that Modi government has become synonymous with ""distorting"" macroeconomic indices and ""slowing down economic progress"". ""Economic Survey 2017-18 has affirmed the utter mismanagement of India's economy by Modi government in the last four years. No amount of new announcements in the presidential address and the forthcoming budget can undo the damage the BJP government has done to a robust economy like India,"" Surjewala said. He claimed the GDP growth is down, agriculture is in ""utter disarray"", rural wages were declining, industrial growth was plunging, job creation figures were invisible, fresh investment was low, education and health spending is in crises. He also claimed that that the 'Make in India' was ""floundering"", price rise was raising its ugly head, and due to demonetisation and a 'flawed' GST, the informal sector, which by the Economic Survey's own admission, has been severely impacted. Surjewala said though the Budget 2017-18 predicted a GDP growth of 7.5 percent for 2017-18, the finance minister has turned out to be more than a full percentage point off the mark. ""This year again, the Economic Survey predicts GDP Growth at 7-7.5 percent for 2018-19, we sincerely hope that this prediction does not become another lame duck prediction, considering the constantly diminishing past track record of GDP growth in the years 2015-16 (8 percent), 2016-17 (7.1 percent) and 2017-18 (6.5 percent),"" he said. Chidambaram said the future course of the economy is conditional ""on many ifs"" and the survey seems to prepare grounds for ""failure"" and the ""outlook is therefore uncertain, if not bleak"". ""The survey has thrown the burden on private investments and exports. It is obvious that the government has thrown in the towel and hopes that the private sector will come to the rescue of the economy! There is not much gas left in the government,"" he said.",PTI
": Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has said he is ready to move a no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government with the support of other parties to get ""justice"" for the southern state.

TDP sources had said Naidu, who heads the TDP, was planning to convene an all-party meeting soon to discuss ways to build pressure on the Centre to secure the state's ""rightful"" due. Ties between the BJP and TDP came under severe strain after the latter accused the Centre of making ""insufficient"" allocations for Andhra Pradesh in the Budget 2018-19. ""But a no-confidence motion should be the last resort. We will continue our fight for justice to Andhra Pradesh. If that doesn't happen, we will muster support from other parties and move a no-trust motion,"" the TDP president announced at meeting of Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti in Vijayawada.

While dismissing their demand, Naidu had said that the Modi government enjoys ""full majority"". YSRC president YS Jaganmohan Reddy announced that his party would move the no-trust motion if the TDP did not do so. But Naidu cautioned against this and said it would backfire. ""If you move a no-confidence motion, they (BJP) have majority. It will be defeated and you can't talk anything for six months on the issue,"" the chief minister told reporters at the Polavaram project site this afternoon. ""First there should be a debate... we have to muster support... Injustice was done (to Andhra Pradesh) right inside Parliament. Now we are demanding justice from the same Parliament. When our minister (YS Chowdary) demanded in Parliament that justice be done to the state, they (YSRC) demanded his dismissal (citing rules and procedures). Now they are talking about no-confidence,"" he said. Naidu had said that provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, and the promises made by the then prime minister Manmohan Singh in the Rajya Sabha have not been implemented yet. ""We are also part of India. When I say that, they (YSRC) say we will run away by resigning (from Parliament) or moving a no-confidence motion,"" Naidu said. He had accused Jagan of trying to gain an ""upper hand"" to corner the TDP on the special category status issue. ""Without understanding parliamentary procedures and traditions, he (Jagan) wants to show he took an upper hand and cornered the TDP and the government. What is that you cornered? People are watching everything,"" he said. The chief minister said his government would take the lead to secure the state's rights from the Centre. ""Let them come with us and cooperate. But they are asking us to follow them. Who are they? What's their history,"" he questioned. Following the protests by Andhra Pradesh MPs in Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that a formula will soon be worked out to release funds under a special package to Andhra Pradesh.

Earlier on 24 January, the student (21), was arrested after she demanded Rs 2 crore from Katare and then came forward to collect the first instalment of Rs 5 lakh, police said. Katare had complained that the woman had been calling him since 17 January threatening to file a rape case against him if he did not pay Rs 2 crore to settle the issue. Following the case against Katare on Friday, the Congress said that it was an effort to harass Katare. ""This is being done to harass Katare, who himself had filed a complaint against this woman for blackmail. She was caught red-handed while accepting money from Katare,"" Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi said.",PTI
"China has banned hip-hop songs and actors with tattoos from appearing on television shows, the   magazine reported on Monday. In its new guidelines, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said hip-hop represented a decadent culture. Hip-hop is still young and developing in the country. It gained popularity among youngsters in 2017 with the TV show “Rap of China”,   reported.  Singers Wang Hao, who goes by the name “PG One”, and Zhou Yan, known as “GAI” (pictured above), had won the show. Both received warnings in recent weeks for allegedly bad behaviour and for performing songs that are at odds with the values of the Communist Party of China.  Last week, GAI was taken off the popular show “The Singer” that airs on Hunan TV. The state-run Xinhua news agency wrote that PG One “does not deserve the stage”, and that “we should say ‘no’ to whoever provides a platform for low-taste content” days after the singer was reprimanded and forced to apologise for “lewd lyrics” in his songs. Rapper Vava was also edited out of the variety show “Happy Camp” on Hunan TV because of her association with hip-hop culture.  This crackdown is part of a broader attempt by the Communist Party to use popular culture for propaganda and close down potential platforms for dissent by the youth. Over the years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has accrued political power to become the country’s most   leader since Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. ",Scroll Staff
"One person was killed and 14 others were injured when a mob clashed with the police over entry of newly-appointed Urdu teachers in a school in West Bengal’s North Dinajpur district Thursday, police said.

"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of initiating Income Tax Department   in connection with an alleged case of tax evasion. At a press conference called after I-T sleuths raided 16 properties with links to Gahlot, AAP spokesperson Atishi told reporters that the Centre was blatantly using internal agencies, such as the I-T Department, Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Delhi Police, to intimidate AAP. ""We must be one of the only political parties in India whose funding comes solely through donations, and also one of the few that receives an income tax notice every day,"" she said. The AAP spokesperson alleged that the BJP was attacking Gahlot only to hinder the party's political progress. She emphasised that Gahlot was being targeted because he was leading the legal battle over the disqualification of 20 AAP parliamentary secretaries. Referring to their disqualification as ""unconstitutional"" and ""illegal"", Atishi said: ""The central government has tried, time and time, again to disqualify our parliamentary secretaries and have a bid for re-election. However, Gahlot's persistence in the case has prevented them from doing so."" She also said that the BJP wants to block the Delhi government's doorstep delivery of services, where, too, Gahlot is at the forefront. The Arvind Kejriwal government had launched the scheme last month, wherein 40 government services can be home-delivered for Rs 50. Launched in association with a private agency, it envisages a ""mobile  "" visiting homes for a nominal fee to help people avail of these services. Kejriwal, too, reacted to the I-T raids on Gahlot, calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to comment on the earlier raids that were conducted on him and Satyendra Jain, Delhi's health and power minister. The CBI had raided Kejriwal's house in Delhi's Civil Lines area in February to collect evidence related to an alleged assault on Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash by AAP MLAs.

""Congress has done divisive politics. As a result of that, terrorism was at its peak in the country (during Congress rule).

""Wherever (Congress president) Rahul Gandhi will go, the party candidate will face defeat. No candidate wants Rahul Gandhi's meeting in his constituency. Rahul means guarantee of defeat,” the UP CM said in an election rally in Churu district's Ratangarh constituency.

"Responding to reports of ATMs running dry, sparking fears of a cash crunch, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, on Tuesday, 17 April, said that the shortage was caused due to “sudden and unusual” demand in currency. He assured that it was a “temporary” situation and was being “tackled quickly” Reminiscent of the days following the demonetisation move announced by the Narendra Modi government in November 2016, non-availability of cash in ATMs have been reported in several states, including poll-bound Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The national capital Delhi too has reportedly been hit by the cash crunch. “The level of cash, according to the central bank, is now close to the pre-demonetisation level at Rs 18.4 lakh crore as of 6 April. But in terms cash-to-GDP ratio, it’s still lower at 10.9 percent compared to 12 percent before the note ban,” reported  . The Ministry, in a statement, said that the first 13 days of the month saw Rs 45,000 crore increase in the supply of currency but assured that the government has adequate stock to meet the demand in the coming days. The ministry said that the government was taking all steps to ensure that ATMs are supplied with cash and to get non-functional ATMs normalised at the earliest. The current shortage is related to local demand and supply, R Gandhi, former deputy government of the Reserve Bank of India, told BloombergQuint. “Currency demand depends on occasions such as elections, festivals where we see a spike. Also, when state and central governments pay out their social welfare schemes in currency, there’s a spike.” Gandhi said the pockets of surplus and deficit are managed through transferring currency. Another reason for the cash shortage is that payments to farmers have gone up during the ongoing procurement season, Rajnish Kumar, Chairman of the State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, told ANI. Banking Secretary Rajiv Kumar told  that the shortage of Rs 500 notes will remain for five to seven days. “The government has stepped up supply.” More than 85 percent of ATMs are operational and only 10-12 percent have faced the crunch, he said.

"Several media bodies, including the Press Club of India, on Sunday, 24 June, sought strict action against senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Choudhary Lal Singh over his ""threatening and intimidating"" remarks directed at Kashmiri journalists. In a joint statement, the Indian Women's Press Corps, Press Club of India, Press Association and Federation of Press Clubs of India said, ""We, the undersigned organisations, demand that strict action be taken against the lawmaker for making threatening remarks hinting possible violence at journalists in the valley. Lal, former minister in the Mehbooba Mufti-led Jammu and Kashmir government, had warned Kashmiri journalists to draw a line between reporting facts and supporting terrorists or face the fate of   editor Shujaat Bukhari, who was shot dead by militants. In an apparent reference to the murder of   editor Shujaat Bukhari, BJP leader Chaudhary Lal Singh on Friday, 22 June, asked the journalists in Kashmir to draw the line and mend their ways,   reported. Addressing a press conference in Jammu on Friday, he said Kashmir media has created “a wrong narrative regarding the Kathua rape-and-murder case,” the report added. Singh had started a campaign across the Jammu region, demanding a CBI probe into the Kathua rape-and-murder case after he was made to resign as forest minister along with industries minister Chander Prakash Ganga in April for participating in a rally in support of the eight men arrested in the case, reported PTI. Singh said the ""unilateral ceasefire"" announced in view of the holy month of Ramzan was the ""biggest mistake"" as it had allowed terrorists to regroup and had dented the “morale of security forces”, PTI reported. “They took a stand on the ceasefire and talked to the Centre, which unwillingly accepted it in view of the holy month of Ramzan. The chief minister's stand was a big mistake. Not only Jammu bore the brunt of it, militancy got strengthened and spread to every nook and corner of the valley,” he said. He said that the previous Mehbooba Mufti government was the “worst-ever” dispensation in the state and more damage would have been caused had his party not pulled out of it. He hailed BJP President Amit Shah for taking the “right albeit late decision”. The ousted minister accused Mufti of being ""pro-separatist"" and said she started her political career by shedding tears, in an indirect reference to her visits to meet families of slain soldiers. “They (PDP leaders) are their (separatist) sponges. Her life started with their support,” he alleged, adding that his demand for a CBI probe into the Kathua case was declined. “I am senior to her in politics and I can say with authority that she will never become chief minister again,"" he said. Defending the PDP-BJP combine, Singh said, “Mufti Mohammad Sayeed stitched the alliance keeping in mind the mandate given by the people to the two parties. But Mehbooba proved incompetent and failed to do justice to the different regions.” Singh's statement drew condemnation from the National Conference. The party termed his remarks “outrageous” and said they merited immediate cognisance by the state police. Earlier, NC Vice President and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: Asking whether BJP leaders had some special knowledge of Bukhari’s assassination, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala condemned the remark, calling it “shocking & reprehensible”.

" Pakistan prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi reversed his decision to take stern action against Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-i- Insaniyat Foundation fearing that any such move could trigger a political crisis, a media report said on Monday. Pakistan has come under intense pressure to rein in terror groups after US President Donald Trump accused the country of harbouring terrorists and suspended nearly $2 billion in security assistance to it. The JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the Mumbai attack that killed 166 people. It has been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014. At a meeting, Abbasi said both the outfits ""should be banned but Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal was of the view that if these organisations were banned at this point, the government would be facing a similar crisis which it faced in November,""   reported, citing two different sources who attended the meeting last month. In November, sit-in by supporters of Islamist organisation Tehreek Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah led by Khadim Hussain Rizvi in Faizabad had paralyzed the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. In the meeting, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Finance and Economic Affairs Miftah Ismail and Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua apprised him of the possible repercussions of the upcoming Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) meeting that could decide to place Pakistan on the watch list of countries that financially aid terrorism, the paper said. After their input, Abbasi constituted a three-member committee, comprising Iqbal, Ismail and Attorney General Ishtar Ausaf, to finalise the decision of taking a strict action against the JuD and FIF, it said. The committee decided to resolve the issue through a presidential ordinance bringing an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997 enabling the law to freeze all the assets of the organisations banned by the UN Security Council. The paper quoted Ausaf as saying that still a notification by the interior ministry was required to formally ban both the organisations. Following the 9 February presidential ordinance, the federal government formally ordered the freezing of all the assets of JuD and FIF across the country without placing them in Schedule I of Anti-Terrorism law, the paper said. Early this month, Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah had said that on the interior ministry's directions, Saeed and his charities have been banned to operate in Pakistan and the government has already started taking over all the facilities, offices, schools, dispensaries and seminaries that belong to the JuD and FIF. The law explicitly defines placement of any organisation into the banned list that is not enabling the police to take any legal action against both the organisations. ""Although the federal government has decided to freeze the assets of JUD and FIF through the law, it does not empower the provincial police to register cases against their activists, so we’ve taken over their assets but not registered cases against their activists,"" the paper quoted a senior officer police officer as saying. Citing sources, it said a formal notification of placement of JuD and FIF in Schedule I was still awaited. Without the said notification both the organisations will not be formally admitted as a defunct organisation at the federal and provincial levels. The sources claimed that in the same pretext the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) has refused to update its list of banned organisations on its website.

"Blaming the low turnout of voters and overconfidence as reasons for the BJP's loss at the recently concluded bypolls for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha constituencies, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said ""every defeat is a lesson for us."" Adityanath was a part of the session   at the   Rising India Summit from Lucknow through video conferencing. ""Victories and losses are not a moment of happiness or sadness for us. Whenever we work with overconfidence and take results for granted, we will end up not working hard enough, so such results will naturally happen. Our workers and voters thought these are the seats of the chief minister and deputy chief minister, and so they took them for granted. Some didn't step out to vote, some didn't go for door-to-door campaign,"" Yogi said. Prior to becoming the chief minister, he had won the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat five times consecutively since 1998.  However, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister appeared unfazed by the alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. ""We admit mistakes in Gorakhpur. These elections have shown that the SP, BSP and Congress cannot face BJP alone. We have analysed the loss in Gorakhpur and prepared our plan to fight the alliance. We can't reveal our roadmap now,"" Yogi said. ""During Uttar Pradesh elections, our leader and face was Modi. Today, SP and BSP have created an alliance. They should decide who their leader is — Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav or Mayawati,"" he said.

It is a matter of faith. We are hopeful of the verdict being in our favour,"" the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. Yogi, however, did not appear to be optimistic about the efforts being made by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on resolving the issue outside the court. ""If there is anyone with a good solution, then that should be considered. This issue has been long debated upon and many have tried to find solutions but there would always be one party that walks out of the discussion. Discussion on any matter isn’t bad, but the Ayodhya matter has been discussed numerous times in the past,"" he said.

""All people are safe in Uttar Pradesh and nobody is living in fear in the state. Protect the 22 crore people of Uttar Pradesh is my responsibility and I will do my best to do that. Kasganj violence was not a communal incident,"" he said, referring to the violence that happened on 26 January this year. ""Nobody is scared in Uttar Pradesh. Holi and Jumma were on the same day this year. On my appeal, Muslim clerics extended the time for Jumma,"" Yogi said while assuring that Muslims in Uttar Pradesh are not living in fear.

"The Congress on Thursday accused the Centre and the erstwhile BJP-PDP government in Jammu and Kashmir of ""spoiling"" the atmosphere in the state and held them responsible for the current situation there, where people are ""afraid"" to cast their vote. The Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, who hails from the state, said this was not the first time that voter turnout in municipal polls in the Kashmir Valley has been low compared to that in the Jammu region. Senior party leader Ambika Soni alleged that the state and central governments are squarely responsible for the current situation and for bringing the state to a level where the ""fear of bullet forced people not to cast their vote"". The two leaders claimed the previous Congress-National Conference government in Jammu and Kashmir had helped normalise the situation and people had been coming out in large numbers to exercise their franchise. But the erstwhile BJP-PDP government and the Centre has brought the situation to that prevailing in the early 1990s, they alleged. ""The Central government spoiled the entire atmosphere in the Kashmir Valley and took us back to the early nineties. ""So I squarely hold the Centre responsible for this, for creating a situation where people are afraid to go to the polling stations,"" Azad told reporters after former PDP MLC Vikramaditya Singh, the son of ex-Union minister Karan Singh, joined the Congress. The second phase of the municipal polls in the state on Wednesday, saw 78.6 percent of over 1.28 lakh voters exercising their franchise in Jammu, while in Kashmir region 3.4 percent of 2.20 lakh electorate cast their votes. The low voter turnout in Kashmir was in line with a meagre 8.3 per cent turnout in the Valley during the first phase of the election.

""This is not first time since we had militancy, which has been for almost three decades. In between, of course, things had improved when we were in power. After the BJP and the PDP formed a coalition government, things went from bad to worse. ""So, for this we shouldn't be held responsible, the Centre and the BJP should be held responsible for worsening the condition of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. On being asked about holding simultaneous polls for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and the Lok Sabha, Soni, who is AICC general secretary in-charge of party affairs in the state, said the Congress has fought elections despite tough situations. ""We congratulate all the candidates, but that doesn't change the scenario there... With what face or how are they (BJP) going to convince the people that the law and order situation is in full control. We will assess it after this election,"" she said. After joining the party, Vikramaditya Singh said he was disillusioned with the PDP as it ""failed"" to fulfil its promises and ""betrayed"" the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Vikramaditya Singh had joined the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party (JKPDP) at the instance of Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and was nominated as a member of the state Legislative Council in 2015. He resigned in October, 2017, both as an MLC and from the party, following differences with the coalition government headed by then chief minister Mehbooba Mufti. Azad said Karan Singh had joined Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet heralding a young generation entering politics and now his son, Vikramaditya Singh, has joined the Congress heralding the entry of the new generation. ""Vikramaditya Singh brings with him a rich political legacy and we hope that he will help weaken the BJP and strengthen the Congress in the Jammu region and in the state of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said. The PDP-BJP combine had formed government in the state with promises of reducing distances between people of the Jammu, Ladakh and Kashmir regions and ushering in development in the state, but just the opposite has happened, Azad alleged. ""Distances between people of the three regions of the state have risen, unemployment and terrorism have also spiked, while development and tourism went down,"" the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said. Vikramaditya Singh said he quit the PDP as ""it betrayed the people of Jammu and Kashmir by not fulfilling the promises made to the people, including safety and facilities like making bunkers for them and farmers living along the Indo-Pak border"". Vikramaditya Singh said he was happy that he was in the Congress to which his father belonged and remained a member for over 50 years. Besides Soni and Azad, Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir was also present at the joining event of Singh.

"Former Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pravin Togadia began his indefinite fast in Ahmedabad on Tuesday in support of his demands, including construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. The 62-year-old Hindutva leader, who quit the post of VHP's international working president last week after his nominee Raghav Reddy lost a key organisational poll, launched the fast outside the state VHP headquarters in the Paldi area at 12 pm with some Hindu saints and supporters. Togadia had earlier said his hunger strike would be aimed at the welfare of Hindus and to draw attention to his demands. These included construction of a Ram Temple at Ayodhya, a nation-wide ban on cow slaughter, enforcement of the common civil code and resettlement of displaced Kashmiri Pandits. Earlier, Togadia was to sit on fast at GMDC Ground, but the police denied permission after which the venue was earlier today shifted to outside the VHP headquarters. 
""We were denied permission by the police to go ahead with fast at GMDC Ground so we had to change the venue,"" said former VHP city president Raju Patel. The surgeon-turned-firebrand leader had launched a scathing attack on prime minister Narendra Modi after he quit VHP, a right-wing outfit with which he had been associated 
with for decades. Togadia quit the right-wing organisation after former Himachal Pradesh governor V S Kokje was elected VHP international president defeating his nominee Reddy on last Saturday. Modi and Togadia, both of whom hail from Gujarat and started out as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteers, drifted apart in the last decade with Modi's rise. Togadia had made a sensational claim last month, saying a Rajasthan Police team had come here to ""abduct"" him and he feared he could be eliminated in a ""fake encounter"". During the long-drawn tussle within the state BJP between Modi (before he became prime minister) and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, Togadia was believed to have backed the latter. The former VHP leader belongs to the Patel community. Togadia recently met Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel, who had campaigned against the BJP in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections.",PTI
"Accusing Tejashwi Yadav of dragging his name in the shelter home sex scandal, Bihar minister Suresh Sharma on Friday lodged a defamation suit against the RJD leader. Sharma, who holds the urban development ministry and represents Muzaffarpur constituency in the state Assembly, filed his complaint before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Hari Prasad. The matter is likely to be taken up for hearing on 29 August. Notably, the BJP MLA had in July sent a legal notice to Yadav — the Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly — for alleging that he had close links with Brajesh Thakur, prime accused in the sexual abuse of 34 girl inmates of the shelter home run by his NGO. Sharma has maintained that his name was being dragged in the scandal because he was the local MLA and has insisted that he has no relations with Thakur. Meanwhile, Yadav has demanded the minister's resignation and accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of being ""scared"" of pressing for the same as Sharma belonged to the BJP, which was in power at the Centre. Manju Verma, an MLA of Kumar's JD(U), had resigned as the social welfare minister in July after it came to light that her husband had spoken to Thakur 17 times between January and June. The scandal had come to light following a   before the state government earlier in 2018. Medical examinations pointed at the possibility of 34 of of the inmates of the shelter home, all minor girls, having faced sexual abuse. Altogether 10 persons, including Thakur — who headed the NGO which ran the state-funded shelter home — were arrested in pursuance of an FIR lodged by the social welfare department.

"The Delhi High Court will on Thursday resume hearing on the petition by Associated Journals Ltd (AJL), publisher of the National Herald newspaper, against their eviction from the Herald House. The high court had adjourned hearing in the case on 15 November and said the status quo should be maintained till 22 November at the Herald House from where the National Herald newspaper is published. Justice Sunil Gaur's order came on a plea filed by AJL on 12 November, challenging the Centre's 30 October direction that the Herald House be vacated. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured the court that it will follow court's direction and maintain status quo till 22 November. The AJL alleged that the Centre was ""illegally, unconstitutionally, arbitrarily and in a deliberate attempt"" trying ""to suppress and destroy the legacy of the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru"". The urban development ministry had said the Herald House's 56-year-old lease to AJL had ended and asked the AJL to vacate the premises by 15 November. While hearing the petition on 15 November, AJL's counsel and senior advocate Abhishek M Singhvi had told the court that two officials of the Land and Development Office had entered the National Herald premises. Mehta, had refute the claim, and had said that he would look into the matter. The court had said the Land and Development Office could not take possession in such a way and would have to follow proper procedure under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act. The government had assured the court that it would not take possession of the premises but it wanted to initiate legal proceedings to have the building vacated. The AJL had told the court that it had been publishing the National Herald newspaper for decades. There was a temporary suspension due to financial trouble, but the newspaper and its digital media operations have fully resumed. The weekly ' ' was resumed on 24 September, 2017, and it is published from the Herald House. On 14 October, the AJL resumed its weekly Hindi newspaper. The government reportedly inspected the premises a few months ago and found that the area allotted to AJL was not being used for the publication of the newspaper for the past 10 years, the court was told. AJL said those who came for inspection did not visit the rooms where the printing press was installed along with stocks of papers. Countering the allegation in connection with Young Indian being a shareholder of AJL, Singhvi told the court the change in shareholding does not mean that the property has been transferred to Young Indian, and that AJL still owns the premises. Young Indian is a firm in which UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi each own a 38 percent stake. He said AJL remains the leaseholder of the building and that the addition of a new shareholder does not in any way violate the lease conditions nor does it constitute sale or transfer of the property.",FP Staff
" Days after accusing the media of misconstruing his remark against a woman farmer, an upset Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Thursday said he would not address the press hereafter ""for any reason."" The chief minister, who has often hit out at the media for ""misinterpreting"" his comments, said he would ""limit the media to what I speak from the stage."" ""From here on, I will limit the media to what I speak from the stage. I have decided. I will not address the press for any reason. If you want, write or else, leave it,"" he said. Addressing an event in Bengaluru, he alleged that his words were often interpreted differently, ""so these days, I don't understand what to speak. I may in the future have to speak, based on the suggestions made by a committee that will be formed about what chief minister has to speak. I'm in such a situation,""Kumaraswamy said. ""An advisory committee should be formed consisting of media friends. It will be good. On the suggestion that they give, I will speak. I'm ready for that. With great pain I'm saying all this,"" he said. Since coming to power, Kumaraswamy has repeatedly blamed the media for ""misinterpreting"" his statements and ""misleading"" the people. Recently, during the sugarcane farmers' protest too, he had accused the media of instigating protesters and blamed the scribes for wrongly interpreting his statement against a woman farmer. Kumaraswamy had earlier courted controversy following his government's decision to impose certain restrictions on the entry of visitors, including the media, to the Vidhana Soudha, the seat of state legislature and secretariat. He had cited police inputs regarding security as also increase in the number of people visiting it everyday besides complaints about inconvenience caused to ministers and officials to carry out their work as reasons for the move then. Hitting back at state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa, who had Wednesday said his party would fight till the Kumaraswamy-led administration is brought down and people get justice, the chief minister said he was ready to face the saffron party leader during the Winter Session of the Assembly at Belagavi commencing from 10 December. He said, ""I will not run away. I and my government have that strength and moral right."" Asserting that he was honestly working for the people of the state and would not run away from the responsibility fearing criticism, Kumaraswamy said he would stand strong and was ready for anything.

"The Indian rupee on Thursday, 16 August, opened at an all-time low of 70.25 a dollar. The local currency fell further to 70.32 per dollar. It has fallen 2.51 percent so far this month. The 10-year bond yield opened at 7.84 percent. Union Minister Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday that India holds sufficient foreign exchange reserves to mitigate any undue volatility in the foreign exchange market. Geo-political pressures, along with outflows of foreign funds and high crude oil prices dragged the Indian rupee to its previous lowest ever intra-day level of over 70 against the US dollar on 14 August when it plunged to 70.08, the lowest ever, against the greenback. However, intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and stabilisation in the global currency markets pared the rupee's early fall.

"Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday wrapped up the third leg of his Jan Ashirwad Yatra in Karnataka by slamming the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Apart from continuing his temple visits, Rahul held two mega rallies, one in Indira Gandhi's old constituency Chikmagalur, and another in Hassan. In a hard hitting attack on the BJP, Rahul accused it of spreading violence, forming governments using money and dividing the country for the sake of power. He also lashed out at Modi, charging him with ""insulting"" the common man by claiming credit for the country's progress. ""Wherever Modi goes he says in the last 70 years nothing has happened. He is insulting your parents, poor farmers, labourers, small businessmen of India,"" he said. If the country today stood as equal to other countries of the world, it had not happened in two years,  it took years of time, sweat and blood of common people, Rahul added. ""Modi should stop insulting the common man,"" he told a party rally at Padubidre in coastal Udupi district. ""No single person can take a country forward,"" he noted. ""In Meghalaya, Manipur and Arunachal they bought governments using money. They purchased MLAs to form government in Goa. You have seen it all,"" Rahul charged. Three days after using Mahabharata analogy at the Congress plenary where he compared BJP to the Kauravas who fought for power and  the Congress to the Pandavas who battled for truth, Rahul once again invoked the epic tale. ""They will do anything for power. BJP is like the power-hungry Kauravas. They are fighting for power, we are fighting for truth. Modi   will come and repeatedly lie,"" he said, addressing public meetings ahead of the Assembly polls. Attacking BJP president Amit Shah, the Congress chief called him a ""murder accused"". He accused the prime minister of favouring big business by waiving their loans and ignoring farmers. Rahul also dismissed regional opponent Janata Dal (Secular) as the BJP B-team. He said the party had taken it upon itself to ensure BJP's win and struck a back channel deal with the BJP thinking that people would not understand. ""But let me tell you. They can bring A-team, B-team, or C-team, there is only one party that is going to win Karnataka and that is Congress party,"" Rahul said. The Congress president, who visited the northern parts of the state during the previous two rounds, was on Wednesday concluding a two-day trip of south coastal Karnataka and Malnad regions. Chikmagalur, which has a strong BJP presence but was also once Indira Gandhi's constituency, and Hassan, the home district of former prime minister and Janata Dal (Secular) supremo HD Deve Gowda, were on his itinerary on Wednesday. In his rally at Hassan, Rahul challenged Modi's claims that the Karnataka government was corrupt. He referred to the Punjab National bank scam and said money was taken away from people's pockets and put into banks and a few days later Nirav Modi ran away with ""your money worth Rs 22,000 crore."" ""Nirav Modi ran away with the money of people of India and  (Modi) was just watching. Don't know whether the   was just watching or he opened the door, it is still not clear. This is the truth about Narendra Modi,"" he said. He said: ""Since Modi  has brought up the topic of corruption, I too will add a couple of words. When prime minister speaks of corruption, he is flanked by Yeddyurappa who spent time in prison over corruption charges. He doesn't see corruption in Jay Shah's wealth. Prime minister doesn't see corruption in Nirav Modi running away after looting crores. Prime minister doesn't tell you the price of the Rafale planes and why he gave the deal to his industrialist friends."" He said Modi makes ""big speeches but there is no weight in what he speaks, he makes promises, and he distributes promises like toffees… take this... take this…"" Rahul also accused Modi of not respecting the Indian people. Invoking Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Rahul said India can't be ruled until the prime minister has love, affection and respect for its people. ""When Atal   was Leader of Opposition, even then he had love and affection in his heart for people. He never trivialised others' contribution in building he nation. He never said, like Modi, that no one has done anything before me,"" Rahul said. He said that when people look at their prime minister, they want to hear words of motivation and love, not of hatred. He thanked the people of Chikmagalur for supporting Indira when she was at a low point in her political career and urged them to vote for his party. He told the people he will channel all the energy given to him in form of their love to defeat the BJP and RSS' divisive agenda.",FP Staff

" The Congress-JD(S) combine on Thursday moved the   against Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala's alleged move to nominate an Anglo-Indian member to the Assembly, saying it should not be done till the floor test in the House. The interim application, filed this afternoon, is likely to be heard on Friday along with the main petition of the combine on which the apex court in the wee hours on Thursday refused to stay the swearing-in of   as the chief minister of the state. In a fresh plea, the Congress-JD(S) has sought a direction that the nomination of the Anglo-Indian member by the governor, if done, should be set aside till Yeddyurappa undergoes the floor test in the House to prove majority.

": The Opposition Congress in Goa on Wednesday claimed that it had the support of over 21 legislators in the 40-member Assembly, giving it enough strength to form the government in the state. The Congress, which is the single-largest party with 16 MLAs, has already staked claim to form the government in the coastal state. The Opposition party's claim comes at a time when Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar (62) is admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi for a pancreatic ailment. Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Chandrakant Kavlekar told   that the Congress had enough support to form the government in Goa. ""We have the required numbers. I am not going to tell you whom we are in discussions with, but we need the support of 21 MLAs and we have more than that,"" he said. The Congress legislators, led by Kavlekar, had met Governor Mridula Sinha on Tuesday and demanded a floor test by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government to prove its majority in the Assembly. Kavlekar said his party was waiting for a response from the governor, who had assured them that she would get back on the issue in three-four days. The state is being ruled by the BJP with the support of the Goa Forward Party (GFP), the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Independent MLAs. The BJP has 14 seats in the Assembly, the GFP and the MGP have three each and the NCP has one. There are also three Independent legislators. Kavlekar claimed the political situation in the state was in the favour of the Congress as there was a lot of ""discontent"" among the ruling coalition partners. ""You have seen how the BJP observers came to Goa and met their legislators, former MLAs and alliance partners. They are also talking about inviting a leader from one of the allies to head the government. ""This has created a bitter situation as allowing one alliance partner to head the coalition will upset another,"" he said. Kavlekar also claimed that a section within the BJP was upset over the possibility of a leader being ""imported"" from outside and was in touch with the Congress for joining the opposition party. ""We need not go to anyone with the proposal of supporting or joining us. In fact, they are coming to us with proposals,"" he added.

On 18 May too, the Congress had staked claim to form the government in Goa, citing the example of Karnataka, where the largest-party, the BJP, was invited to form the government after the Assembly polls threw up a fractured verdict. The Congress had said it was not invited to form the government in Goa after the Assembly polls last year, despite emerging as the single-largest party.

"Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s four-day visit to the United Kingdom and Germany starting August 21 has been eventful – and not just because a   posted by the party’s official handle went viral and was widely mocked. Packing in several events in these two countries, Gandhi made a number of statements that have resulted in a steady stream of attention and led to mini-controversies. Among other things, he contended that unemployment in India has led to lynchings, that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh reminded him of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood and that the Congress party was not involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots Here is a rundown of his most notable remarks:  At the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London on August 24, Gandhi   the RSS, the Hindutva organisation, to the Muslim Brotherhood, a political Islamist group founded in 1928 in Egypt. He also said that the idea of demonetising old Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, announced by Narendra Modi in 2016, came from the RSS, and claimed that the finance minister, the Reserve Bank of India and the Union Cabinet were unaware of the decision. “RSS is trying to change the nature of India,” he said. “Other parties haven’t tried to capture India’s institutions. RSS’ idea is similar to the idea of Muslim Brotherhood in the Arab world…And the idea is that one ideology should run through every single institution; one idea should crush all other ideas.” While addressing the Indian Journalists Association in London on August 25, Gandhi said that he had no ambition of becoming prime minister, according to a   by the  “I don’t have these visions [of seeing myself as prime minister],” he said. “I view myself as fighting an ideological battle and this change has come in me after 2014. I realised that there is a risk to the Indian state, to the Indian way of doing things and I am defending that.” He added that the 2019 general elections would be “pretty straightforward” as the Opposition, through its multiple alliances, would fight against the BJP. “I can tell you, the original idea of India is going to win, 100%,” he said. “We are defending an onslaught on the Indian Constitution and institutions. Me and the entire Opposition see it as defending the nature of the Indian state.” On August 24, at the UK Parliament in London, Gandhi was   about the criminal involvement of Congress party members in the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, in which at least 2,433 people were killed in Delhi alone. Gandhi condemned the attacks, but also said that he did not think that the Congress party was involved. “I have no confusion about it in my mind,” Gandhi said. “It was a tragedy. It was a painful experience. You say that the Congress party was involved in that, I do not agree with that. There was certainly violence. There was certainly tragedy.” He said that anyone found guilty of wrongdoing should be punished, and that he would “support that 100%”. His comments on the non-involvement of the Congress party in the riots triggered criticism from the BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal. Gandhi was again questioned on the 1984 riots at another event later that day, held at the London School of Economics. In his response, he referred to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s apology made in Parliament in 2005. “When Manmohan Singh spoke, he spoke for all of us,” he said. He also added that he knew what it was like to be a “victim of violence” and condemned violence of any sort. At the London School of Economics, he said that he could not ignore senior leaders as they added value to the party,    . He said that the party faced an internal threat of “arrogance”, when questioned about its strengths and weaknesses. “The present has to be a merger of the future and the past and that is really why the Congress ran into trouble in 2014,” he said. “…Because we found that there was an internal fight taking place between the older generation and the younger generation and a lot of the work we have done now is try to bring them together successfully.” Hours after his remarks, the Congress, on August 25, announced the formation of three panels for the 2019 elections – the core committee, the publicity committee and the manifesto committee. These committees comprise both senior leaders and new faces. In June, 2017, the Indian and Chinese armies engaged in a standoff at Doklam, an area on the tri-junction of India, Bhutan and China that is claimed by both Beijing and Thimphu and is of strategic importance to New Dellhi. At the  , Gandhi was asked how he perceived the issue and how he would tackle it if he were the prime minister. He said that while he did not have the details of Doklam, he was certain that “the Chinese are still in Doklam today”. “Doklam is not an unrelated episode,” he said. “It is not a one off. It is not a border issue. It is a strategic issue. It is a part of a sequence of events. Doklam was a crisis that happened because the government is episodic.” He added: “The government and prime minister views things very much from an event perspective. I view Doklam as a process, as a point in a process. I would look at the process and tackle the process.” During the same event, Gandhi said that he supported the surgical strikes by the Indian Army on Pakistani posts across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir in 2016. The publication of the final draft of the National Register of Citizens in Assam on July 30 has led to bickering between the BJP and the Opposition. The register, a list of all Indian citizens in Assam, is being updated for the first time since 1951. The stated aim of the exercise is to identify and root out those whom the State deems to be “illegal migrants”. The terms of inclusion in the register were laid down by the Assam Accord of 1985 –when Rajiv Gandhi was the prime minister – the culmination of a six-year-long anti-foreigners’ agitation in the state. Under the terms of inclusion, anyone who cannot prove that they or their ancestors entered India before midnight on March 24, 1971 – the eve of the Bangladesh War – will be declared a foreigner. The final draft left out   names. Speaking at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Gandhi said that he   with the exercise but questioned its implementation. “We started it [updating the National Register of Citizens in Assam],” he said. “It was our idea. But there is serious issue with the implementation.” He added: “There are a large number of people who are Indians from all communities who are in that list.” At the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Gandhi was asked about the   between the Congress and the BJP, given that some “businesses had ideological proclivities” with the ruling party. Gandhi responded, saying that businesses were “facing pressure” from various institutions in the country and that the BJP had “tremendous power” to hurt these businesses. “You will be surprised with the mood of the business community in India,” he said. “It will shock you. The business community expected a tremendous amount from Mr Modi and pretty much all of them are coming to us and telling us that he failed. A lot of them are telling us that they will support us. They are saying that they are terrified to say it publicly and, ‘for god’s sake don’t tell anybody’.” He also claimed that the BJP would lose the 2019 general elections if Opposition parties formed an alliance in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two states that hold a chunk of Lok Sabha seats. In Germany, on August 23, Gandhi   that incidents of lynching and mob violence occurred in India due to unemployment and the harm demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax had caused to small businesses. He claimed that demonetisation destroyed the country’s cash flow and led to a widespread loss of jobs in the informal sector. He criticised the Goods and Services Tax by stating that its implementation was “badly conceptualised…badly thought out” and had led to the closure of small businesses. “When you hear about lynchings in India…when you hear about attacks on Dalits in India…when you hear about attacks on minorities in India…that’s [lynching] the reason for it,” he said while addressing a gathering at Bucerius Summer School on Global Governance in Hamburg.",Scroll Staff

"The BJP’s tally in the Gujarat Assembly polls was restricted to 99 seats because “butchers”, “bootleggers” and those opposing the proposed triple talaq Bill didn’t vote for the party, Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja said on Thursday, 22 February. In the elections held last December, the BJP managed to retain power for a sixth straight term though its tally fell to 99 seats. The Congress won 77 seats in the 182-member House. He was speaking on the Motion of Thanks to Governor OP Kohli’s 19 February address to the House on the first day of the Budget Session, when the topic veered towards the BJP’s poll performance following a dig by the Congress. Jadeja said the Congress gained only 77 seats though its leaders tried to incite people through casteist and communal politics. “Congress leaders used to claim ahead of the polls that the party will come to power by winning over 125 seats. However, they got only 77 seats,” he said. In an apparent dig at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Jadeja said, “Though a top Congress leader, who never visited temples before, visited so many temples ahead of the polls, it did not help the party come to power in Gujarat”. Jadeja said the BJP came to power “with the votes of rural people, youths who got employment, and women who benefited from the policies of the government”. Meanwhile, in a veiled attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress MLA Vikram Madam said, “Good dialogues will help a movie to become successful (but) to run a country successfully, you need concrete plans… It was the BJP’s vision to win 150 seats.

"In his Rajya Sabha debut, BJP president Amit Shah hit back at Congress' ""Gabbar Singh Tax"" barb and said that tax collected is used to fund pension, development schemes. The   Session of the Parliament is set to resume on Monday after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tabled the Union Budget 2018-19 on 1 February, the Narendra Modi's government's last full Budget before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The first leg of the session will be held between 29 January and 9 February. Following a recess after 9 February, the Parliament will convene again between 5 March and 6 April. Some of the issues likely to find limelight on Monday in both Houses are listed here: Upset over ""injustice"" to Andhra Pradesh in Union Budget 2018-19, the TDP, a key ally of the BJP, on Sunday decided to raise the issue in Parliament. Andhra Pradesh chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu asked his party MPs to pressurise the BJP-led NDA government to undo the injustice. At the TDP Parliamentary Board meeting in Amaravati on Sunday, Naidu said the party would begin its fight by raising the issue in Parliament, sources revealed. He made it clear that this was only the first step. The TDP chief said the party's next course of action would depend on the response of the Modi government. The Board discussed in detail the Union Budget and the Centre's failure to address the pending issues of the state. Some TDP leaders suggested that both the central ministers of the TDP should quit to put pressure on the BJP. Naidu, however, said the party should first raise the issue in Parliament. TDP leader and Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Y Sujana Chowdhary told reporters MPs would try to put pressure on the Centre to honour all commitments made to the state at the time of its bifurcation from Andhra Pradesh in 2014. According to reports, the Congress and some Opposition parties have made it clear that they will press for discussion in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the ""crisis in judiciary"" following the issues raised by four senior judges of the Supreme Court in an unprecedented press conference in January this year.

Responding to three separate questions in the Rajya Sabha on the ""rift"" in the higher judiciary, the government said it has not received any information about it from the Supreme Court. Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary replied in a negative when asked whether the government has ""assessed the impact of the rift"" in the apex court. ""Judiciary, being an independent organ under the Indian Constitution, is capable of handling its internal matters. The government is committed to the independence of judiciary,"" he said in a written reply to one of the questions.

Besides the triple talaq legislation, which criminalises instant talaq by Muslim men, the government is also likely to make a pitch for the passage of the OBC bill, which seeks to give a constitutional status to the OBC commission. The BJP hopes to consolidate its support among backward classes by according constitutional status to the OBC commission, which, it believes, will give it more teeth.

" The CPM on Wednesday alleged that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had made a poll promise of creating two crore jobs is now assuring ""pakoda jobs"" to millions of people looking for work. Modi in a television recent interview claimed that people earning Rs 200 a day selling pakodas can be considered employed. ""Now we have it from the prime minister himself that massive employment has been created by people selling goods on streets,"" former CPM general secretary Prakash Karat wrote in an editorial in the party journal ""People's Democracy"". ""What the prime minister promises is more 'pakoda jobs' for millions of new entrants to the job market,"" it read. The CPM leader termed Modi's remark a ""cruel joke"".

The Left leader argued that people become ""self-employed"" because there is no regular employment or jobs available in the formal sector. ""Thanks to the neo-liberal policies, there is a type of economic growth which does not produce jobs, except low-paid jobs in the informal sector and mainly contractual jobs in the organised sector,"" he wrote.

"Christopher Wylie, a former employee-turned-whistleblower of data firm Cambridge Analytica, said that India’s Congress party was a client of the disgraced firm in his deposition hearing in the UK House of Commons. When asked if Cambridge Analytica “focused on the world’s largest democracy” – a major market for Facebook which has “lots and lots of elections” – Wylie said he believed Congress was one of their clients. Wylie added that he could provide the court with documentation regarding Cambridge Analytica’s Indian operations. Wylie's earlier testimony also came up in the hearing about his Romanian predecessor, who worked in India and was found dead in Kenya in 2012 ""with bits of his skull missing"".

The Congress, however, categorically denied the accusations and reiterated their stand that the party had no business dealings with Cambridge Analytica and added that the firm helped the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP and the Congress have been sparring over their alleged connections to Cambridge Analytica ever since the data breach scandal came to light. The IT Minister had earlier alleged that the British firm helped in increasing Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter popularity.

" The Congress on Saturday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of trying to “influence” voters in Karnataka on the polling day through his temple visits in Nepal.

Even Rajnath Singh was seen smiling. However, after PM Modi mocked Gandhi’s “dramatics”, all party leaders seemed to have unanimously concluded that the Congress chief had broken the decorum of the Lok Sabha. While Rajnath Singh called it a “Chipko Andolan”, Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said Rahul was on drugs. BJP MP Kirron Kher said that Rahul Gandhi should head to Bollywood for his love of “doing drama in the house”. On 23 July, Goa BJP spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik added to the string of names being used to criticise Gandhi, by saying that he had winked “like a loafer”. Meanwhile, the Opposition party MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco on Tuesday, 24 July, hit back at the BJP leader calling him a ""bootlegger"". ""Naik's party (BJP) has lost credentials and lost touch with human nature. Naik is a bootlegger,"" Lourenco told reporters on the sidelines of ongoing Monsoon Session of the Assembly. Lourenco, who represents Curtorim Assembly segment in South Goa, said Gandhi was neither involved in any illegal activity nor in any kind of crime. Even Twitter did not take too kindly to the BJP leader’s comments. Those who called out Naik for the comment seemed to have the same question to ask: (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" A Delhi court on November 1 extended the protection from arrest to former Union minister P. Chidambaram and his son Karti Chidambaram till November 26 in the Aircel-Maxis money laundering case filed by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate. The ED filed a reply to Chidambaram’s plea for anticipatory bail in the case on October 31, maintaining that his custodial interrogation was necessary as he was evasive and non cooperative in the probe. On Thursday, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and A.M. Singhvi, appearing for Chidambaram, submitted that they will argue on the anticipatory bail application and also respond to the ED’s reply. Taking note of Chidambaram’s submission, special judge O.P. Saini extended till November 26 the protection from arrest granted to him. Chidambaram filed his anticipatory bail application in May this year. His protection from arrest has been extended from time to time. “We have to meet a deadline and he (Chidambaram) is not cooperating,” additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI and the ED, told the court. “From the conduct of the petitioner, which gets amply demonstrated from the records available, the investigating agency has reached a bona fide conclusion that in the absence of custodial interrogation, it will not be possible to reach the truth of the allegations as the petitioner has chosen to be evasive and non-cooperative,” the ED said on Wednesday. It sought Chidambaram’s custodial interrogation, saying he has not been cooperating with it in the probe and therefore making it difficult to complete the investigation in a time-bound manner as directed by the Supreme Court. The senior Congress leader’s role has come under the scanner of investigating agencies in the Rs 3,500-crore Aircel-Maxis deal and the INX Media case involving Rs 305 crore. In its charge sheet filed earlier in the case against former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran and others, the CBI alleged that Chidambaram granted FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) approval in March 2006 to Mauritius-based Global Communication Services Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Maxis. The Maran brothers and the other accused named in the CBI charge sheet were discharged by the special court, which said the agency had failed to produce any material against them to proceed with the trial. The ED is also probing a separate money-laundering case in the Aircel-Maxis matter, in which Chidambaram and Karti have been questioned by the agency.",PTI
"The Bharatiya Janata Party will have much to cheer about on Saturday, with results to Assembly elections in three North East Indian states – Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland – putting the saffron outfit in the driver’s seat in the region. Although final results are yet to be declared, the trends by afternoon suggested that the Bharatiya Janata Party was set to win outright in Tripura and was likely to be in a position to form the government in both the other states, though that will still depend on successfully stitching up alliances with regional players.  While the main focus has been on the BJP’s performance across the three states, the results are likely to also turn the spotlight on the shrinking presence of the Congress – which was once the pole around which elections in the region operated – as well as the diminishing fortunes of the Left, which is on course to be out of power in Tripura for the first time in 25 years. In Nagaland and Meghalaya, local players have taken the place that was once occupied by the Congress.  Trends from the Election Commission suggest that the BJP has managed to bring down the Left government, which had been in power in the state for 25 years. As of 3.30 pm, the alliance of the BJP and the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura were leading in as many as 43 seats, which would put them well over the half-way mark of 30 in the 60-strong Assembly. The Left, at the same time, had leads in just 16 seats, down from the 50 it had managed in 2013. If these trends hold, the BJP – which had just 1.54% of the vote share in elections five years ago – will form the government along with the IPFT, its junior partner.  You can follow live results  . Results in Meghalaya are the least certain of the three states where counting took place on Saturday, in part because of how well spread out the vote share was. More than five parties got vote shares of over 10% each, meaning the final result is likely to be a hung Assembly, especially since there were no major pre-poll alliances among parties even though some of them are allied outside the state.  As of 3.30 pm, the incumbent Congress is on course to be the single largest party, with 21 seats in the 60-strong Assembly. The National People’s Party, which is part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance at the Centre but was not contesting in an alliance with it in the state, is leading in 19 seats. These are followed by a clutch of smaller regional parties, and the BJP, which is leading in just 2 seats.  Despite this result, the BJP might still be in a position to be part of the government in the state, considering its relationship with the NPP, and the likelihood that the regional parties may work to build an alliance that keeps the BJP-ruled Centre on their side.  You can follow live updates  . In  , the BJP   its 15-year-old alliance with the ruling Naga People’s Front ahead of elections to tie up with the newly formed Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party, run by former Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio. The main fight in the state was thus likely to be between the incumbent NPF and the challenger NDPP, along with its junior ally, the BJP.  As of 3.30 pm, the NDPP-BJP alliance is leading in 27 seats, while the NPF along with its ally, the National People’s Party, is leading in 25 seats. If those are the final results, the 60-member Assembly would be hung, forcing either side to cobble together an alliance that would constitute a majority. Analysts expect that the BJP will be a part of the government, whether it involves the NDPP or the NPF, since its position of power at the Centre gives it leverage.

" Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has urged all political parties to boycott elections till the Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines or the ballot paper system are not made available. In a letter written to chiefs of various political parties, he said since the elections in 2014, there have been doubts about the credibility of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). The allegations that EVMs are being tampered have been confirmed in all subsequent polls, he claimed. ""In so many constituencies, our corporators and MLAs worked relentlessly and yet they faced defeat. In fact, in so many places the candidates got zero votes. Now, how is this possible?"" Thackeray questioned. He said the First World countries like USA, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan and Korea chose to discontinue the use of EVMs and reinstated the ballot system. ""The only countries still using EVMs are India, Nigeria, Venezuela, among others. Why are we insisting on this disputable method?"" the MNS chief asked. One cannot push aside the possibility of EVMs being hacked during the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls due next year, he said, adding that the fundamental right of freedom of expression stands infringed. ""To add to this, if even the Election Commission is coming under siege, then we, as a democratic country, will cease to exist,"" he said. ""I appeal to all political parties to come together and demand that till the time VVPAT machines or ballot paper system are not made available, we will not fight elections,"" Thackeray said. MNS secretary Sachin More told   that along with the letter, Thackeray has also enclosed a pen drive having an audio-visual demonstration of how EVMs can be hacked, which has already been demonstrated in the Delhi Assembly. VVPAT is a method of providing feedback to voters using a ballot less voting system. It is an independent verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify that their vote was cast correctly.",Press Trust of India

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday   that the Congress government in Karnataka was in sleep mode and had not spent the funds that the Centre had allocated for the state’s development.  Not a single project could be undertaken in Karnataka without corruption and bribery,   quoted Modi as saying. “Look at rising illegal mining in the state,” the prime minister said at an election rally in Ballari. “Congress government in Karnataka could not even frame a strong mining policy.” In a jibe at Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, the prime minister said the state had a “Sidda-rupaiah” government that has burdened the state with debts.  Look at the rising illegal mining in state. Congress govt here couldn't even frame a strong mining policy. Karnataka has a 'Sidda-Rupaiah Sarkar'. It has created a debt-burden for the state: PM Modi in Ballari    “When we had got the opportunity to serve people of Karnataka earlier, so many development initiatives were undertaken,”   quoted Modi as saying. “But sadly, Congress could not even ensure proper water supply despite the state being rich in water resources.” The prime minister accused the Congress of  targeting Ballari like thieves and thugs, and destroying its rich history and legacy. The prime minister did not mention the Reddy brothers, who have   prominently in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s campaign. The Congress continued to   the party and the prime minister over the matter. Dear PM Modi, As you arrive in Bellary, we look forward to hear your commentary on corruption. Don’t forget to mention Reddy’s record scam score of 35,000 cr & still not out. With star players like Yeddy-Reddy, your score in Karnataka will be well short of 60. Earlier in the day, the prime minister addressed another rally in Kalaburagi district where he accused the Congress of not respecting the sacrifices of Indian soldiers. “When our soldiers carried out surgical strikes, the Congress party questioned them,” the prime minister said. “They kept on asking proof of the strikes from me.”  After the strikes, one Congress leader had called Army chief General Bipin Rawat a “gunda [thug]”, Modi alleged. He pointed out that Field Marshall KC Cariappa and General KS Thimayya were born in the state, and alleged that both were mistreated by the Congress governments. “History is proof of that,” Modi said. “In 1948, after defeating Pakistan, General Thimayya was insulted by PM Nehru and Defence Minister Krishna Menon.” After surgical strikes, one of Congress's senior leaders called our current Army Chief a 'Gunda': PM Narendra Modi in Kalaburagi    Modi accused the state government of misleading Dalit communities, and alleged that the party did not make Mallikarjun Kharge the chief minister despite promising him the post. “This is typically how Congress plays politics,” the prime minister said.

" Political parties were divided on the issue of holding Lok Sabha and Assembly polls simultaneously, with four supporting the idea and nine opposing it, even as the ruling BJP and the main Opposition Congress stayed away from a   of India on the subject. At the end of the two-day consultation on simultaneous polls, besides NDA ally Shiromani Akali Dal, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Samajwadi Party (SP) and Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) supported the idea. However, BJP ally Goa Forward Party opposed the concept, as did the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), All India Forward Block (AIFB) and the Janata Dal (Secular) (JDS). The SP, TRS, AAP, DMK, TDP, JD(S) and AIFB met the Law Commission to put forth their views. The SP, represented by Ram Gopal Yadav, supported the concept, but he made it clear that the first simultaneous polls should be held in 2019, when the term of the 16th Lok Sabha comes to an end. If simultaneous polls are held in 2019, the tenure of Yogi Adityanath's BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will be shortened. AAP's Ashish Khaitan told the law panel that simultaneous elections are a ""ploy"" to keep people away from forming a government as the terms of Houses will be extended if the two polls are held together. He also dubbed the idea as a move to impose ""managed"" democracy"" in the country, a senior law panel functionary present in the deliberations said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be governing the country, not addressing rallies, if simultaneous polls are held. In a written response to the law panel, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said his party supports the idea as months are spent preparing for polls throughout the year. B Vinod Kumar, who represented the TRS at the meeting, said the analysis that local issues would be overshadowed by national issues if simultaneous polls are held is incorrect. He gave examples of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to drive home the point that voters cast ballots keeping in mind both national and local issues. The TDP also opposed the idea, saying: ""Simultaneous elections are no longer feasible in a vast country like ours with different political complexities of the Assemblies. It is not possible to cut short the tenure of Parliament and Assemblies. Simultaneous elections are incompatible with the Constitution and are also impracticable."" The DMK, JD(S) and AIFB  . JD(S) representative Danish Ali told the law panel that the idea is against federal democracy. He said if the government is interested in electoral reforms, it should first implement earlier law panel reports on election reforms and then discuss simultaneous polls. On Saturday, the Shiromani Akali Dal had supported the concept, saying it would reduce the expenditure of parties and shorten the period of the Model Code of Conduct, which hampers development work. The AIADMK, represented by Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai, had said holding the two polls together is ""desirable"", but certain ""practical"" and ""serious"" issues need to be settled first. The AIADMK was of the view that if necessary, simultaneous elections should be held in 2024 and not before that. Sources said the party was also of the view that the Tamil Nadu Assembly should be allowed to complete its term, and the Lok Sabha elections should be held as per schedule. The TMC was represented by Kalyan Bandhopadhyay, a Lok Sabha member, at the meeting. His party, too, had   saying, regional issues would be overshadowed by national issues, and national parties with their ""money power"" would steal a march over smaller players. The CPI, All India United Democratic Front and Goa Forward Party also expressed similar views. The BJP, which has voiced its support to the proposal, has   to present its views on the issue. It has been told to do so by 31 July as the term of the present panel ends in August end, sources said. The Congress, meanwhile, said it will consult other Opposition parties on the issue before making up its mind. Last week, the CPM had last week told the Law Commission that holding the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls together is inherently ""anti-democratic"" and negates the principles of federalism, which is a fundamental feature of Constitution. CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury had written to the panel, listing the party's objections to the proposal stating that it goes beyond the ambit of law reform entailing major amendments to Constitution and would run against both the ""letter and spirit of our Constitution"". Yechury had said it ""may not be necessary"" that his party attends the consultation. Seeking to give shape to the government's concept of ""one nation, one election"", the Law Commission's internal working paper has recommended holding the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls simultaneously but in two phases beginning 2019.",Press Trust of India

"In an interview with PTI on Sunday, 26 August, Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that a formidable alliance of opposition parties can be stitched together to defeat the BJP and free India from the ""reign of fear"" in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

": Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik has favoured holding of early election to the Assembly, saying he does not think a popular government can be formed out of the present house after the collapse of the BJP-PDP coalition dispensation in June. The state has been under Governor's rule since Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti resigned as chief minister in June following the withdrawal of support by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to her government.

Asked if a popular government can be formed out of the present Assembly, the Governor replied, ""I don't think so. At least, I will not be part of any 'dhandli' (shenanigans). I have not been given any such indication either by the prime minister or by any other central leader.""

""The decision will be taken by the Centre and the Election Commission. My job is to discharge dual responsibility (of Governor and administrator) which I will continue to do... I wish that elections are held at the earliest,"" he said. On the contentious issue of Article 35A of the Constitution, which empowers the state's legislature to define the permanent residents and provide them special rights, the Governor said that his administration would seek deferment of the hearings on the matter in the Supreme Court. ""We will inform the Supreme Court that we are not an elected government and request that the matter be deferred till an elected government is in place,"" he said. The Supreme Court, in its 31 August order, has directed that the matter be listed in the second week of January 2019.

" CPM leader Brinda Karat on Sunday slammed the BJP for allegedly forging an alliance with Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), a non-Left tribal party. ""They had formed an unholy alliance to divide Tripura for narrow electoral politics. Tripura had emerged as a state with extraordinary success in over two decades of Left rule. There is a concerted effort to disrupt peace and tranquillity in the state,"" she said while addressing a public rally in Sonamura. The CPM politburo member also alleged that the IPFT had collaborated with insurgents on one hand and the BJP on the other. Referring to a meeting between an IPFT delegation and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on 5 January, she said the Centre has announced to form ‘modality committee’ that would examine the feasibility of the separate statehood demand — something that was unheard of in the nation’s politics. However, the state BJP refuted Karat's charges and said it was completely against the division of the state. BJP state President Biplab Deb told reporters that the Centre has agreed to form a committee with the representatives of the state and central government as well as tribal experts to examine the socio-economic and socio-cultural condition of the tribals, who form a third of the state's population. Karat claimed Tripura had set unparallelled instances in public education, healthcare, infrastructure and several other sectors and said peace was a compulsory pre-requisite of development. She blamed the IPFT for dividing the state on ethnic lines and disrupting peace. There were separatist demands in Vidarbha and other parts of the country, but no such committee was formed and added that the BJP completely washed its hands off the Gorkhaland movement in Darjeeling in West Bengal after winning the elections. She appealed to the poll-bound people of the state to form the 8th Left Front government.

" The Delhi BJP on Sunday alleged that the AAP was indulging in ""cheap political gimmicks"" over the sensitive issue of the felling of trees after its government-issued necessary permission for it for the re-development of residential facilities for central government employees. ""It is sad to see cheap political gimmicks being played in such a sensitive issue by the Delhi government after it issued permission to fell trees,"" Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said. 
Tiwari said that he belonged to an agrarian family and the news reports of the felling of trees and 'Chipko' movement-type agitation by the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had disturbed him a lot. ""It is sad that for sheer politics of Kejriwal Party is belittling the piousness and significance of Chipko Andolan, which was run to save the green character of an entire terrain, by comparing it to the present situation where the green character of the area will not be disturbed except for in a very small area,"" according to a press statement issued by the party. The BJP president said, ""...I firmly believe existing green cover should not be cut until inevitable."" ""It was Delhi government which gave the mandatory permission for the felling and replantation of trees as required under law in full knowledge of the minister concerned, Imran Hussain, and therefore the ongoing drama by the ruling party is nothing more than a cheap gimmick,"" he said. ""The project authorities have ensured that almost three trees shall be planted for every one tree cut and most of these newly planted trees will grow up in two years by the time the project completes,"" he said. Tiwari said that yet a delegation of the Delhi BJP would soon meet Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri and request him to see that as many trees as possible are spared from cutting or are transplanted in the vicinity and new trees are planted before the start of monsoon. ""Delhi BJP strongly condemns the dirty politics of gimmicks being played by Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party in this matter,"" he added. Locals, activists and environmentalists protested today against the government's order to fell over 14,000 trees for the re-development of seven south Delhi colonies. About 1,500 protesters hugged the trees in Sarojini Nagar, launching their own ""Chipko Movement"", a forest conservation movement where people embraced trees to prevent them from being cut in Uttarakhand (then Uttar Pradesh) in the 1970s.",Press Trust of India
"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas mounted a fresh attack against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, after the latter apologised to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the remarks he had made against him. Questioning the Delhi CM's apology to not just Jaitley, but also to others leaders, such as former Punjab minister Bikram Majithia, Vishwas told ANI: The written apology tendered by Kejriwal was in connection with his allegations of irregularities in the Delhi District Cricket Administration (DDCA), which was once headed by Jaitley. Along with Kejriwal, AAP leaders Sanjay Singh, Ashutosh and Raghav Chadha also apologised. Jaitley accepted the apology. A joint plea has also been moved by the finance minister along with Kejriwal before a Delhi court seeking to settle the criminal defamation case filed by the former against the latter. However, Vishwas will not be apologising to Jaitley, a close aide of his told PTI. Vishwas reportedly did not move any plea to settle the litigation, meaning that the defamation case against him will continue. After Kejriwal started issuing apologies for the remarks made by him against his political opponents, last month, Vishwas had said that he would fight the defamation cases filed against him, reported PTI. Of late, the relationship between Vishwas and the party leadership, helmed by Kejriwal, has been frosty. Embroiled in a legal mess with 30 defamation lawsuits, Kejriwal has been on an apology spree since last month.

She goes on to say that after no development on this front for 10 years, she found out after taking over the post that the deal was only to buy a plain lock. Joshi further says that the maintenance and upgrade of such locks would have come at a cost, and that the total amount would have exceeded Rs 10,000. She says she renegotiated the entire deal with the same company at a lower cost and also ensured that some parts of the locks were ""Made in India"".

" The Supreme Court on Monday, November 19, deferred till November 26 the hearing on a plea filed by Zakia Jafri challenging the clean chit given by the Special Investigating Team (SIT) to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in connection with 2002 riots in Gujarat when he was the chief minister. Zakia, the wife of Ehsan Jafri, an ex-MP who was killed in one of the worst incidents during the riots, has challenged the Gujarat High Court’s October 5, 2017 order rejecting her plea against the SIT’s decision. A bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Deepak Gupta said that “the matter would take some time for detailed hearing and the plea will be heard on November 26”. The court also said that it will also look into the application by social activist Teesta Setalvad on becoming a co-petitioner in Zakia’s plea ahead of hearing the main case. At the outset, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said Zakia’s plea was not maintainable, and raised objection to Setalvad becoming the second petitioner in the case. “As far as petitioner number 1-Zakia Jafri-is concerned, she was a complainant in the case and she approaching the Supreme Court is understandable. The objection is with respect to petitioner number 2-Teesta Setalvad. She claims to be a journalist but she was no where either in the trial court or the high court. How can she jump in like this?,” Rohatgi said. He said that the appeal does not have a single supporting affidavit filed by Jafri and all the affidavits filed are by Setalvad, who describes herself as a journalist. “The trial court had given its finding in the matter. The high court also passed its order on the plea and gave a concurrent finding. The issue is of 2002. This can’t go on and on, endlessly. Somewhere it has to stop and the petition must be dismissed,” Rohatgi said. Senior advocate C. U. Singh, appearing for Zakia, said that the main petitioner is a 80-years-old lady and therefore, Setalvad has been made petitioner number two to assist her. To this, the court observed that one need not become a co-petitioner to assist the petitioner, and said it will look into the application on making Setalvad as the second petitioner in Zakia’s plea before hearing the main matter next Monday. During the last hearing, Zakia’s counsel had said that notice needs to be issued in the plea as it pertained to the aspect of alleged “larger conspiracy” during the period from February 27, 2002 and May 2002. He had pointed out that after the SIT gave a clean chit to Modi, who was then Gujarat Chief Minister, in its closure report in the case before a trial judge, a protest plea was filed by Zakia, which was dismissed by the magistrate without considering the “substantiated merits”. On February 8, 2012, the SIT had filed a closure report, giving the clean chit to Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was “no prosecutable evidence” against them. Ehsan Jafri was among 68 people who were killed at the Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad, when a mob attacked it on February 28, 2002, a day after the S-6 Coach of the Sabarmati Express returning from Ayodhya at Godhra was burnt, triggering the riots in Gujarat. “The present Special Leave Petition is filed before this Court against the final judgement and order dated October 5, 2017 passed by the High Court of Gujarat…which erroneously upheld the order of the magistrate accepting the closure report filed by the Special Investigative Agency appointed by this Court concerning the violence in Gujarat in 2002,” Zakia, in her plea filed through advocate Aparna Bhat, submitted.",PTI

": Buoyed by the bypoll victory in Bihar, RJD MLAs on Thurssday staged a demonstration outside the state assembly demanding resignation of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the ruling coalition's defeat in the by-elections. The RJD registered emphatic victories in Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad assembly seats yesterday. The BJP was defeated in Araria though it succeeded in winning Bhabhua assembly seat. The ruling JD(U) suffered a crushing defeat in Jehanabad. RJD legislators gathered at the main gate of the state assembly and shouted slogans against the NDA coalition in Bihar. ""The results of the bypolls are an expression of public resentment against Nitish Kumar, who betrayed the mandate by walking out of 'Mahagathbandhan',"" RJD MLA Bhai Virendra, who led the slogan-shouting MLAs, told reporters. Leader of Opposition Tejaswi Yadav had last evening demanded Nitish Kumar's resignation. ""The voters have rejected 'double engine' governments of NDA at the Centre as well in Bihar. Hence, Nitish Kumar should tender resignation,"" he said. HAM president Jitan Ram Manjhi, who had quit NDA on the bypolls eve to join hands with RJD, was present with Tejaswi Yadav last evening to celebrate the victory at Araria and Jehanabad.

The scope of work of the social media agency, intended to be selected through the impugned request for proposal (RFP), is in the teeth of the judgment by this court in the K S Puttaswamy case, wherein a bench of nine judges of this court recognised privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution,” the plea said. The petition claimed that the aim of employing a “Social Listening Tool” by the UIDAI’s social media agency in accordance with the RFP, on the pretext of raising awareness about Aadhaar, was nothing but an attempt to “overreach the jurisdiction” of the apex court. “Despite the fact that the constitutional validity of various aspects of Aadhaar is under challenge before this court in a batch of petitions and judgement has been reserved by a Constitution Bench of this court in the matter, the respondents (Centre, UIDAI) have issued the RFP to identify ‘top detractors’ and ‘neutralise negative sentiments’ in relation to Aadhaar. It is, therefore, clear that the respondents have no respect or regard for proceedings before this court,” the petition read. The MLA has alleged that the haste with which the RFP was being pushed through, with the bids scheduled to be opened less than two weeks after the publication of the RFP itself, demonstrated the mala fides of the Centre and the UIDAI. The plea claimed that weekly and monthly reports are to be prepared by the social media agency, indicating the most discussed topics, top detractors, top influencers and the net sentiment related to Aadhaar. “The entire surveillance architecture is to be placed in the hands of private persons employed on a contract basis who will be on the rolls of the service provider who emerges successful in the tender process. “While surveillance by agents of the State is itself violative of the right to privacy, in this case, the privacy of the citizens of this country is sought to be placed at the mercy of non-State actors which reeks of manifest arbitrariness,” the plea alleged. Earlier, the Centre had told the apex court that it will undertake a complete review of the social media policy and had withdrawn its notification proposing a social media hub for the Information and Broadcasting Ministry. The decision had then led to the disposal of an earlier plea against the hub filed by Moitra against the notification of the I&B Ministry.",PTI

"BSP chief Mayawati accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of indulging in ""politics of vote bank"" by remembering Saint Kabir Das ahead of 2019 general election. ""When the Lok Sabha elections are just round the corner, the prime minister is remembering Kabir Das... Is it not petty politics of vote bank,"" the BSP president said. Mayawati ridiculed Modi's visit to the 'nirvan sthal', the mausoleum of Kabir in Maghar earlier in the day where he held a public rally and laid the foundation stone of an academy named after 15th Century mystic poet. ""Kabir Das is in the hearts of people... BJP should desist from indulging in politics for gaining cheap publicity,"" the BSP chief said. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister further alleged that massive funds were spent on Modi's event at Maghar, where Kabir breathed his last and was buried. ""For laying the foundation stone of the Kabir Das academy to be set up at a cost of Rs 24 crores, almost as much money was spent on the function and its publicity by the BJP,"" she said. The programme was an effort to hoodwink the people of the backward eastern region of the state, she added. ""What happened to the big dreams of achchey din and promises specially made by Narendra Modi before the last Lok Sabha elections,"" she asked. Mayawati said that it was her government which had created a new district in honour of Kabir and proposed the idea of dividing the state into four parts to ensure overall development. Development of the state's eastern region was not possible without the creation of a separate eastern part for which her government had got a resolution passed which is still pending with the Centre, she said.",Press Trust of India

In a major action taken against the turncoats ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections, BJP has removed senior leader Sartaj Singh, former minister Ramkrishna Kusmaria and Bhind MLA Narendra Kushwaha from the party. Singh, who defected to the Congress after being denied ticket from the Seoni-Malwa constituency cried in public after his name did not figure in BJP's list of candidates.

Both the BJP and the Congress are with facing rebellion within party ranks over displeasure with the ticket distribution. However, both the national parties went into damage-control mode and asked the rebels to withdraw from the elections.

"North Korea on Friday accepted South Korea’s offer to hold talks about Pyongyang’s participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and improve bilateral relations,   reported. The talks, which were last held in December 2015, will be take place on January 9 at the border truce village of Panmunjom.   “I believe there will be discussions related to improving South-North ties after the North’s participation in the Olympics becomes final,” the   news agency quoted an official at the South Korean presidential office as saying. The two sides have not yet confirmed the names of the officials who will represent them. “The two sides decided to discuss working-level issues by exchanging documents,” Baik Tae-hyun, the spokesperson at Seoul’s unification ministry, said.  Opposition parties in South Korea, however, remained cautious about the dialogue process, and questioned Pyongyang’s motives behind the peace overture, Yonhap reported. “High-level dialogue must be held, and we hope that it will be successful,” Kim Sung-tae, the floor leader of the main Opposition Liberty Korea Party, said. “But a meeting only about the successful hosting of the Pyeongchang Olympics without discussing the denuclearisation issue will be meaningless.” Ahn Cheol-soo, the leader of the opposition People’s Party, said he was concerned about the “groundless optimism” about the dialogue process. “[The government] must first craft a strategy and then respond to the talks.” Baik Tae-hyun assured that South Korea’s efforts to denuclearise North Korea would continue even as Seoul engages Pyongyang and keeps communications lines open.

"In a   in the course of counting of votes for the Karnataka Assembly Election, the Congress on Tuesday announced its backing to the Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) to form a government to prevent the BJP from regaining power in its only southern bastion. After the initial euphoria of the Bharatiya Janata Party crossing the half-way mark in the 224-member Assembly where two constituencies didn't vote on Saturday, Election Commission data showed the BJP could end up with 104 seats. This would be eight seats short of a simple majority in a House where no one else appears ready to back the BJP. Through the  , several big winners emerged – Congress candidate Siddaramaiah emerged victorious in a tight contest in Badami but lost out in Chamundeshwari; Janata Dal (Secular) state chief HD Kumaraswamy easily won from both Ramanagara and Channapatna; BJP's chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa won in his constituency of Shikaripura. Here are some of the biggest winners of Karnataka Assembly Election 2018: Congress candidate Siddaramaiah emerged victorious in a tight contest in the crucial Badami Assembly constituency with the incumbent chief minister edging past BJP's B Sreeramulu by 1,696 votes. Siddaramiah received 67,599 votes as against B Sriramulu who received 65,903 votes. JD(S) candidate Hanamant Mavinmarad finished way behind in the race in third place with 24,484 votes. Badami, which has a population of over 3.3 lakh (census 2011), had an electorate of 1,96,673 in 2013. It was a crucial contest for the Congress as it has a significant presence of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, Muslims and other backward castes — the bedrock of Siddaramaiah's support base. Siddaramiah decided to contest from the constituency along with Chamundeshwari. The incumbent chief minister gave up the Varuna constituency for his son Yathindra. Janata Dal (Secular) state chief HD Kumaraswamy won easily from both Ramanagara and Channapatna, the two seats he contested from. Kumaraswamy won in Ramanagara with a margin of 22,636 votes and in Channapatna with a margin of 21,530 votes. But with Karnataka set for a hung Assembly, political circles are abuzz with the possibility of a Congress-JD(S) tie-up. The JD (S) has sought the chief minister's seat for HD Kumaraswamy. The BJP is currently ahead in 104 seats, followed by the Congress at 78 and JD(S) at 38. BJP's chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa won in his constituency of Shikaripura by a margin of 35,397 votes. Yeddyurappa has been contesting from the constituency of Shikaripura in Shivamogga district since 1983, having lost only once. He won the seat in 2013 as well— by 69,126 votes — against HS Shanthaveerappagowda of the Congress. Yeddyurappa won the constituency with 86,983 votes ahead of Congress' Goni Malatesha, with 51,586 votes. JD(S) leader GT Deve Gowda won from the Chamundeshwari constituency, defeating Siddaramaiah by over 30,000 votes. While Gowda got a total of 1,21,325 votes, Congress nominee Siddaramaiah polled 85,283 votes. BJP candidate SR Gopal Rao got 12,064 votes. During the initial stage of the counting of votes, Siddaramaiah was seen trailing in both Badami and Chamundeshwari from where he was seeking re-election. While Deve Gowda surged ahead soon after the counting began, a JD(S) victory became a certainty after the twelfth round of counting when he led by a margin of 12,000 votes. Siddaramaiah's son Yathindra won by a margin of over 50,000 votes in Varuna. Yathindra's victory comes after his father Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah vacated the Varuna seat for his younger son. A doctor, Yathindra stepped into politics after the death of his brother Rakesh and is seen as Siddaramaiah’s successor. Yathindra was going to take on BS Yeddyurappa’s son, BY Vijayendra, in Varuna but the BJP fielded Basavaraju instead at the last minute. With the win, this is the third election the Siddaramaiah family has won from Varuna after the 2008 and 2013 Assembly elections when Siddaramaiah had won the seat by a convincing margin. The Congress won the Varuna seat in the 2013 Karnataka Assembly election with a margin of 29,641 votes (18.45 percent) securing 52.53 percent of the total votes polled.

BJP leader KS Eshwarappa won the Shivamogga City constituency by a margin of 46,107 votes.

Dr G Parmeshwara of Congress won in the Koratagere constituency by a margin of 7,619 votes. JD(S) had fielded PR Sudhakar Lal and the BJP had given a ticket to YH Huchaiah. Parameshwara was born in Gollahalli of Tumkur district of Karnataka. The Congress candidate from Koratagere is also the President of KPCC.

": The opposition in the Rajya Sabha on Monday accused the BJP-led government of polarising the country and creating a ""fear psychosis"" among the people, alleging that it was just renaming the earlier policies without delivering their benefits to the poor. It is not a ""game changer"" but a ""name changer government"" which has failed to deliver on all fronts be it providing relief to farmers and poor, generate jobs or addressing the Kashmir issue, the opposition leaders said. Participating in the debate on the Motion of Thanks for the President's address, Leader of Oppositon Ghulam Nabi Azad attacked the government for creating fear, not only among people but also among the bureaucrats and opposition leaders. ""A fear psychosis has set in. You cannot see when you are in power. If someone is scared to talk to the Opposition or transact with them, it is not good for democracy or freedom of speech or even freedom of business,"" he said. Azad alleged that opposition party leaders were being treated as ""potential terrorists"" and their phones were being tapped. ""No one today talks to me over phone because they say your phone is tapped,"" he claimed. Opposition members, including those from the Congress, Samajwadi Party, NCP and the Left parties, have moved as many as 324 amendments to the president's speech as part of the debate on the Motion of Thanks. In his speech, Azad said the government was not only polarising the country, but also dividing parties in the opposition and intimidating them by using the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate. While supporting the draft triple talaq bill, Azad objected to the stringent punishment it proposes for a man for ending marriage through instant triple talaq. ""You have divided Shias and Sunnis. Now, you are dividing husband and wife. You cannot polarise the nation. ... What kind of division are you involved in? Why are you intimidating the minority community who are victims of fear psychosis?"" ""You should spare some section. We don't want this New India. You have polarised it. Return us India of Gandhi where no fear existed,"" he said. Expressing concern over the Kashmir situation, he attacked the government for not framing any clear policy for the troubled state. ""The situation is pathetic. ...Borders are in a sad state of affairs. People are homeless and suffering. The government does not have any clear policy,"" he said, dubbing the NDA government for being ""weakest"" in 70 years. Stating that the recently announced national health insurance scheme is another ""jumla"" (rhetoric) of this government, Azad said it will only benefit insurance firms and not the ordinary citizens. Instead of an insurance scheme for 50 crore people, he suggested that the Centre should focus on building more government hospitals to provide cost effective treatment to the poor. Attacking the government for being insensitive towards farmers, Azad said the government making ""false promises"" of doubling income by 2022, which cannot be implemented with the current budget allocation to the farm sector. A government panel, studying ways to double farmers income, has recommended that farmers income cannot be raised without an investment of Rs 6.4 lakh crore in the farm sector and achieving growth 10-12 percent per annum, he said. ""You cannot achieve farm growth of 10-12 per cent even if you rule next 50 years. You cannot invest Rs 6.4 lakh crore. There is no chance of doubling farmers income. Why do you make such promises which cannot be fulfilled,"" he asked. ""Farmers are committing suicide. You are not doing anything. You are offering only false promises. We object to this,"" he said, adding that the government has kept the deadline of 2022 for several schemes as it does not want to be held accountable. While Naresh Aggarwal (SP) said the Ayushman medical insurance scheme announced in the budget would give advantage to private insurance companies and not the people, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray (TMC) quoted a latest CIA report on India to say that the country had performed badly on all major socio-economic fronts. Supporting the Motion of Thanks, Vinay P Shasrabuddhe (BJP) said the government is providing governance through inspiration, innovation and tranformation and the Prime Minister does not have any ""personal agenda"". On a tweet by Congress leaders on selling of pakoda by some students during a recent prime minister's rally in Karnataka, he said those students did not compromise their self respect and were working hard. Accusing the government for ""repackaging"" the UPA schemes, senior Congress leader listed out the schemes like Swachch Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padao and Mudra which the Modi dispensation changed their names and taking credit. ""It is not a game changer but a name changer government....Where are the new schemes? ...You are implementing only our schemes and trying to take credit. You don't have anything of your own,"" he said while referring to a series of schemes started by the erstwhile UPA government. Azad said the President's speech does not mention of the unfulfilled promises -- be it depositing Rs 15 lakh in poor people's bank accounts, creating of 10 crore jobs, providing MSP 50 per cent more than cost of production or ensuring lower fuel prices. Highlighting the government's failures, he said it has been able to construct only 50 per cent of the targeted 12 crore toilets under the Swachch Bharat so far. ""I don't know how are you going to achieve the target in the next 9-10 months. Moreover, 60 per cent of the constructed toilets are unusable as there is no water, no flush and sewage tank,"" he said, questioning the government for the need to spend Rs 550 crore for publicity of this scheme. He also attacked the government for allocation meagre budget to implement the Beti Bachao Beti Padao scheme while expressing concern over incidents of recent rapes in BJP ruled states. ""What is government doing? Rapes are happening every minute. What kind of New India you are making. If this is new India, we regret,"" he said. Countering BJP charges against Congress on dynastic politics, Azad said there has not been any prime minister or minister from the Gandhi family in last 22 years. He also said the current government was afraid of current leadership of the party. He also said the truth has come to the fore in the 2G spectrum case, while nothing has been found yet by the highest court in the Bofors case. Taking a dig at the government on high petroleum products prices, Naresh Aggarwal (SP) said petrol and diesel prices have risen by Rs 9 and Rs 7 per litre while under UJJAWALA scheme, only one cylinder is being given to the poor at higher refilling price of Rs 800 per cylinder. He strongly opposed the government's idea of 'one nation, one election' for conducting simultaneous polls to state Assemblies and the Lok Sabha. ""Will Yogi Baba (UP CM Yogi Adityanath) be ready for that? First you should amend the Constitution that no assembly would be dissolved before completion of its terms."" On digital transactions, he said only 3 percent of the population pay tax and attacked the government for giving overarching power to taxmen and introducing jail term under tax laws. He also attacked the government for tightening the noose around the realtors saying this sector gave employment to 12 crore people. AIADMK leader A Navaeethkrishnana said the government should allow the states to amend law in the concurrent list and should not sit over the amendments passed by assemblies for long. Giving an example, he said Tamil Nadu assembly passed a bill unanimously to give exemption to students from National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) but it is been pending with central government for approval. Sukhendu Sekhar Ray (TMC) said GST and demonetisation have broken the back of the common man and they are not told how they would cope up with issues arose after that. He dubbed the President's Address as ""nothing but a compilation of 'Mann ki Baat' speeches of the Prime Minister."" On holding assembly and Lok Sabha elections together, he said there is no law to provide for it and, in a sarcastic note, said the government should hold online elections under Digital India. On triple talaq bill, he said no party was opposed to it, but it should be scrutinised by the parliamentary panel as the government cannot abolish the standard parliamentary process. Observing that there was no reference of black money in the President's address, Ray said ""In Panama papers names of 500 Indian appeared and around 900 come on Paradise papers. These all are Indians and not from paradise. The government should come out with a white paper on what action it has taken against the people whose names have appeared in the list."" India's NPA is growing and has gone above Rs 10 lakh crore and the government had done nothing to declare ""wilful default as a criminal offence,"" he said. TK Rangarajan (CPI-M) the number of farmers committing suicide is increasing and the government is seeking time till 2022 to double their income. ""The survey says, wait four more years and by then suicides would be multifold."" He said till now, the government has not set up Cauvery Management Board and the farmers of Tamil Nadu are suffering. While T G Venkatesh (TDP) said the government has ignored several important projects of Andhra Pradesh, D P Tripathi of NCP raised the problems of the girl child, saying India has 21 million unwanted girl child.",PTI
"The Supreme Court Collegium on Friday, 11 May reportedly agreed to reiterate Justice K M Joseph's name for elevation as apex court judge, but decided to send it back together with some other names for appointment. The other names will reportedly be decided on 16 May in another meeting. The Collegium met earlier in the day to decide whether to resend the nomination of Uttarakhand Chief Justice KM Joseph for appointment as judge of the top court. The Centre had earlier returned his nomination to the SC citing his ‘seniority’ as a reason. The meeting was called a day after Justice Jasti Chelameswar, the second senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, wrote to Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra to convene a meeting of the Collegium for the same. On 26 April, the Centre had returned the Collegium's proposal to elevate Justice Joseph to the apex court, saying the recommendation was not in accordance with the top court's parameters and there was an adequate representation of Kerala in the higher judiciary from where he hails. In his letter sent to the CJI late on Thursday, 9 May, Justice Chelameswar conveyed that he was reiterating his decision for the elevation of Justice Joseph as a judge of the top court since there was no change in the circumstance that had led the Collegium to recommend his name to the government on 10 January, PTI quoted an apex court official as saying.

" AMMK leader TTV Dinakran on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the AIADMK leadership, saying the ruling party has ""lost its identity"" and was ""stuck"" due to a ""few selfish"" people. The ousted AIADMK leader also claimed that his Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) would 'retrieve' the ruling party. In an apparent reference to Dinakaran, the AIADMK dubbed him an 'overnight' leader rejected by the people. ""One cannot deny the fact that the party has lost its identity and ideology and veered away from the path laid down by Amma (the late J Jayalalithaa). It is now stuck due to a few selfish persons,"" Dinakaran said without naming anyone. He was apparently targeting AIADMK Coordinator O Panneerselavam and the Joint Coordinator K Palaniswami, with whom he is in a running feud for control of the ruling party. Palaniswami is Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu while Panneerselvam is his deputy. In a letter to partymen ahead of the AIADMK founding day on 17 October, Dinakaran said while the late chief minister MG Ramachandran had launched it, Jayalalithaa had taken it forward and made it a popular movement in the state. His jailed aunt VK Sasikala had stood ""solidly"" by Jayalalithaa during her political journey, he said. But post Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, ""hegemonic forces"" had taken over the AIADMK, Dinakaran said in the letter. Reiterating his oft repeated charge of the AIADMK being 'subservient' to the BJP-led government at the Centre, he said his AMMK would retrieve the AIADMK and restore it to its old pride. The AIADMK has ""lost its identity and become someone's slave,"" he said but did not name anyone. Dinakaran claimed 90 percent of AIADMK workers were supporting AMMK and that the rest were in the ruling party due to ""selfish motives."" ""AMMK has been the true AIADMK. In the coming days, it will retrieve AIADMK,"" he added. His victory in the RK Nagar bypoll in December 2017 was proof of people's sentiments as the voters elected him as Jayalalithaa's successor, he said. The bypoll was necessitated due to the death of Jayalalithaa in December 2016. Dinakaran, who contested as an Independent, had defeated ruling party nominee E Madhusudhanan by a good margin. Meanwhile, Panneerselvam and Palaniswami said those who have emerged as ""overnight leaders"" have been rejected by the people. ""Those not aware of Puratchi Thalaivar's political journey and showing no respect for Puratchi Thalaivi's sacrifices, those building castle in the air about coming to power after having emerged as overnight leaders, those who tried to shake our organisation have been thrown away by the people,"" they said in a letter to partymen. AIADMK founder, the late chief minister MG Ramachandran is addressed by supporters as Puratchi Thalaivar, meaning Revolutionary Leader, while his protege Jayalalithaa is Puratchi Thalaivi for them. Those who had ""underestimated"" AIADMK and its supporters were now afraid of it, the two leaders added. AIADMK was a movement that will strive for generations of Tamils, they said, recalling the late Jayalalithaa's words. Paneerselvam had in February 2017 fallen out of favour with then AIADMK interim general secretary Sasikala and resigned as the chief minister. Palaniswami was subsequently made his successor by Sasikala, who also appointed Dhinakaran as AIADMK deputy general secretary, before leaving for Bengaluru to serve a four-year jail term in a disproportionate assets case. However, in August last year, the factions led by Panneerselvam and Palaniswami merged. Later, a party General Council, under the two leaders, expelled Sasikala from the party and annulled all appointments made by her, including that of Dinakaran. Dinakaran has been since critical of the Palaniswami government, and has repeatedly vowed to oust it.",Press Trust of India

"The Bharatiya Janata Party in Karnataka on Friday petitioned the Election Commission to countermand the bye-election scheduled for November 3 in Ramanagara Assembly constituency days after its candidate   of the contest and rejoined the Congress, PTI reported.  L Chandrashekhar, who was set to go up against Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy’s wife Anita Kumaraswamy, claimed to have withdrawn from the election as he was worried about his future in the BJP and accused the party of abandoning him after giving him the ticket. However, state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa accused senior Congress leader DK Shivakumar and his brother DK Suresh of “giving money” to make Chandrashekhar return to the Congress. In its petition, the Opposition party alleged that senior leaders of the ruling alliance of the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Congress had colluded to ensure no contest takes place. The developments are the “convergence of undue influence” of Chandrashekhar, DK Suresh, Anita Kumaraswamy and the chief minister, it added.  Party legislator and spokesperson Ashwath Narayan submitted the plea to Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar, PTI reported.  The party said Chandrashekhar’s decision violates the “free and absolute right” of BJP voters to cast their votes. “When the candidate has left the BJP and joined the Congress, his name in the voters ballot as BJP candidate has no meaning,” it added. “Therefore, the entire election process is vitiated.” A senior state Election Commission officer told   that it was highly unlikely for the bye-election to be cancelled. “We have not received any instructions from ECI [Election Commission of India],” the official said. “I do not think there is a chance of elections being countermanded. The withdrawal from polls by a candidate after the notified date of withdrawal [October 20] is unofficial. His [Chandrashekar] name and symbols will be in the EVMs. His party had supported till the last day of withdrawal of candidature and that is why his name is already in the ballot.” Ramanagara is one of the two constituencies Kumaraswamy contested the Assembly elections in May from. The chief minister vacated this seat while retaining Channapatna. On Saturday, bye-polls will also be held in three Lok Sabha constituencies – Shivamogga, Ballari and Mandya and in Jamkhandi Assembly seat. Votes will be counted on November 6. ",Scroll Staff
" Urging governors to play a proactive role in making universities promote excellence in academics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said Indian varsities must aspire to be among the world's best. He also asked the governors to strengthen harmony and integration among states. Addressing the concluding session of the Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Modi urged governors, in their capacity as chancellors, to call upon universities to promote excellence in various spheres of academics. He said Indian universities must aspire to be among the world's best and governors can play a crucial role in catalysing their transformation.  In this context, he pointed at the government's initiative to promote autonomy in IIMs, and among top 10 public and top 10 private universities. Referring to the 'Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat' initiative, which promotes partnerships, cultural exchanges and people to people linkages among states, he emphasised the need to build new ways to promote harmony and integration among various states, an official statement said. The prime minister said that the government is working towards promoting 'ease of living' for the common man. He said that governors, through their vast experience in public life, can motivate civic agencies and government departments to work with commitment towards the cause. He also spoke of the government's ambitious health assurance scheme 'Ayushman Bharat'. Modi said that occasions such as the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, and the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, can serve as inspirational milestones for achieving development goals and targets. He said the upcoming Kumbh Mela could also serve as an important occasion for promoting nationally relevant causes, the statement read.",PTI
"A total of 600 academicians have condemned the Association for Asian Studies (AAS) in a letter over their failure to inform the participants of an upcoming seminar after the Centre decided to exclusively bar Pakistani scholars from attending it,  reported. The Association for Asian Studies (AAS), a non-profit professional association, has held an annual conference called ‘AAS in Asia’ for those interested in Asian Studies to participate in discussions since 2014. The   co-organised with Ashoka university is scheduled to take place from 5 to 8 July at the capital’s India Habitat Centre. Foreign scholars had to seek an Indian visa with a copy of the invitation and no-objection letters from the Ministries of External Affairs and Home affairs until the former barred Pakistani scholars from attending the event,  reported. The letter sent by the Ministry to the university on 19 February, read, “The ministry has no objection from the political angle for the proposed event with foreign participants (except participants from Pakistan), as stated in your aforesaid communication, subject to the clearance of Ministry of Home Affairs as applicable and nodal ministry.” The letter further includes a line, “Kindly note this ministry does not recommend participation from Pakistan in the proposed event.” The country’s name has also been struck off the list featuring 57 participating countries. Accusing AAS of lacking transparency, the signatories to the letter added that had the AAS informed in advance that Pakistanis were barred, “participants could have made informed decisions about whether to support and attend the conference,”   reported. “These directives were written in a letter from the Ministry of External Affairs dated 19 February 2018, prior to the deadline for registration,” the academicians cited, adding that last minute cancellation could be a financial burden. A virtual event, a different location or expressing dismay over the Indian government’s decision could have been ways of organising the event differently, Scroll cited from the letter. “The AAS cannot simultaneously claim to represent scholarship on Asia while allowing its conference to become the grounds for the Indian state – or any other state, for that matter – to enact virulent and blatant forms of religious, national, or other forms of exclusionary violence,” the report quoted from the letter. Incidentally, the American Institute for Pakistan Studies was a co-sponsor of the conference. The Association for Asian Studies and Ashoka University, in a   on Friday, said they regretted the government’s decision since it is not “tune with the open exchange of ideas and knowledge that is the very purpose of the conference,” the organisers said.

"Union minister Satyapal Singh has claimed that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution of man was ""scientifically wrong"", and it needs to be changed in school and college curriculum. Singh, the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, said our ancestors have nowhere mentioned that they saw an ape turning into a man. ""Darwin's theory (of evolution of humans) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on Earth he has always been a man,"" he said while speaking to reporters on Friday, 19 January. The IPS officer-turned-politician was in Aurangabad to attend the 'All India Vaidik Sammelan.' ""Nobody, including our ancestors, in written or oral, have said they saw an ape turning into a man,"" he said. In response to Singh’s statement, several leading scientists from various academies have condemned the Union Minister’s remarks and said that it had no scientific basis, reports  . According to the report, three top science academies of India that include The Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi, The Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, and the National Academy of Sciences, Allahabad, put forth a joint statement in response to Singh’s remarks on Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. The three academies, that boast of over 2,000 leading scientists, also said in the statement, ""It would be a retrograde step to remove the teaching of the theory of evolution from school and college curricula or to dilute this by offering non-scientific explanations or myths.” Singh, however, responded to the joint statement by saying that he did have a basis to his argument, as he too hailed from a science background. Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution that states that all species of organisms develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. It was developed by Darwin, a 19th century English naturalist, and others. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint
" A trial court in Mumbai on Wednesday deferred framing of charges against Lt Col Prasad Shrikant Purohit and other accused persons in the 2008 Malegaon blast case. Special judge, National Investigation Agency (NIA) court Vinod Padalkar deferred the framing of charges after Purohit and other accused raised objections on the validity of the sanction for their prosecution under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). One of the accused, former Major Ramesh Upadhyay, argued that first it should be decided whether the UAPA is applicable on them before the trial commences. The judge adjourned the matter and said the court will hear arguments from all the accused on this from next Monday. The arguments will be heard on a day-to-day basis, starting with Purohit, the judge said. The Bombay High Court on Tuesday rejected Purohit’s plea to restrain the trial court from framing charges against him and other accused persons in the case. In his plea, Purohit had urged the high court to stay the framing of charges until the issue of his sanction of prosecution was decided by the HC. The high court had on December 18 last year refused to quash the government sanction for Purohit’s prosecution. He then approached the Supreme Court that refused to intervene in the case on April 20. A prior sanction for Purohit’s prosecution is required since he was a serving Army officer at the time. The sanction was issued on January 17, 2009 by the additional chief secretary of the Maharashtra Home department. Six people were killed and nearly 100 injured when an explosive device strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque at Malegaon, a town in Maharashtra’s Nashik district, on September 29, 2008. On December 27, 2017, the special NIA court had dismissed the pleas filed by Purohit, his co-accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, and six others seeking discharge from the case. The court, however, gave them partial relief by dropping all charges against them under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). Their appeals against this order are pending before the high court. (PTI)",PTI

"In latest updates, Jammu and Kashmir BJP chief spokesperson said that the party showed that the nation was the most important for its policies. Mehbooba Mufti said that she has submitted her resignation to the Jammu and Kashmir governor. She said that muscular policies will not work in the state. Jammu and Kashmir governor NN Vohra met former chief minister Omar Abdullah. Mehbooba Mufti has resigned as Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and sent her resignation letter to Governor NN Vohra, reports have said. Mehbooba Mufti had cancelled all meetings since Tuesday morning after getting a whiff about the New Delhi decision. On the streets of Srinagar people are saying that the break-up was long awaited and hope it happens for the good of people. Mehbooba is set to address media in Srinagar at 5 pm. The PDP has also called for an emergency meeting at 4 on Tuesday evening. Bharatiya Janata Party has snapped the alliance in Jammu and Kashmir with the Peoples Democratic Party which is headed by Mehbooba Mufti, BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir Ram Madhav announced on Tuesday. ""It is good that this government ended. They were both brutal. PDP came to power on the promise it would not allow BJP to form the government but ended up making an alliances with the same party,"" Shuja Ahmad Sheikh, a resident of Srinagar told Firstpost on the Residency Road after the BJP announced that the alliance with PDP has ended. ""The BJP has humiliated PDP like no other regional party could do it. It is move aimed at 2019 elections in India,"" Sheikh said. Madhav said the parties tried hard to maintain the alliance but it became untenable to follow through. ""We had called this meeting (Tuesday morning) to discuss the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Even freedom of expression has become an issue in the Valley,"" Madhav said. ""Terrorism, violence and radicalisation have risen and fundamental rights of the citizens are under danger in the Valley. Shujaat Bukhari's killing is an example,"" Madhav said. ""Centre did everything for the Valley. We have tried to put a full-stop to the ceasefire violations by Pakistan. PDP has not been successful in fulfilling its promises. Our leaders have been facing a lot of difficulties from PDP in developmental works in Jammu and Ladakh,"" said Madhav. Described as ""strange bedfellows"" and ""uneasy alliance"", the BJP-PDP coalition always struggled to run in a state which struggled to sort out any issue amicably. The BJP-PDP alliance was, in fact, called the 'South and North Pole.' As described by Madhav, the problems plaguing Jammu and Kashmir were extremely complex and with an alliance which never saw eye to eye, it was extremely difficult to agree upon anything. This is not the first time that differences have cropped up between the alliance partners. Earlier, the PDP reportedly threatened to pull out of the coalition over the issue of two BJP ministers rallying behind the Hindu Ekta Manch, which was demanding a CBI inquiry into the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua district. The BJP had asked both the ministers to resign from cabinet. The Bharatiya Janata Party pulled out of the alliance with the People's Democratic Party, pushing the Mehbooba Mufti-led is Jammu and Kashmir government i minority. The news comes amid reports of growing tension in the BJP-PDP alliance, each blaming the other for rising militancy, mob violence and low voter turnout in the recent parliamentary bypolls. Amit Shah met the Jammu BJP leaders on Tuesday after which the party has called a press conference. The BJP central leadership would deliberate on the party's strategy in the state ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and also take stock of the political situation in Jammu and Kashmir, sources said. ""All the BJP ministers have been called to New Delhi for a meeting,"" a senior Jammu and Kashmir BJP leader told  . BJP state chief Ravinder Raina and party general secretary (organisation) Ashok Kaul have been also called for the meeting.

"The Supreme Court on Friday ordered that a floor test be held in the Karnataka Assembly at 4 pm on Saturday to ascertain whether newly appointed BJP chief minister BS Yeddyurappa enjoys majority in the state. ""Let the House decide and the best course would be floor test,"" a three-judge bench headed by Justice AK Sikri said. The bench also asked the newly elected government not to take any major policy decision till it proves majority in the House. It also ordered authorities, including the DGP, to ensure law and order outside the Karnataka Assembly. The apex court made it clear that it would deal with the constitutionality of the governor's letter inviting Yeddyurappa to form the government later. The bench said ultimately the question is about majority which has to be proved in the floor test. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Congress, said that the party is ready for it but ""the entire proceedings should be videographed and ensure proper security to MLAs to vote fearlessly"". Supreme Court, however, rejected the videographing proposal. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Yeddyurappa, suggested the floor test to be conducted on Monday, but the apex court rejected the suggestion while adding that the floor test should happen at the earliest. During the hearing, Yeddyurappa placed before the Supreme Court letters that he had sent to Governor Vajubhai Vala in which he had staked claim to form the government in Karnataka. Yeddyurappa, who was sworn in as Chief Minister of Karnataka on Thursday, told a special bench comprising Justices AK Sikri, SA Bobde and Ashok Bhushan that being the single largest party the BJP was the ""mandate of people"" of the state who have thrown out the Congress. Rohatgi told the bench that there was no pre-poll alliance between the Congress and JD(S) and they have formed an ""unholy alliance"" after the elections. The apex court is hearing a petition moved by the Congress-JD(S) combine challenging the governor's decision to invite the BJP to form the government. ""The single largest party (BJP) is the mandate of people of Karnataka who have thown out the ruling party. The ruling party has much less members than us. There was no pre-poll alliance. It (Congress-JDS) is an unholy alliance,"" Rohatgi said. At the outset, the bench asked the Attorney General KK Venugopal, ""Have you brought those letters (sent to the Governor by Yeddyurappa)?"" Venugopal told the bench that Yeddyurappa was being represented by Rohatgi, who placed the letters before the bench. The bench directed Rohatgi to give the copies of the letters to the counsel appearing for Congress-JD(S) combine. Rohatgi, while reading out then operative part of the 16 May letter sent by Yeddyurappa to the governor, said the BJP leader had said in the letter that the party has emerged as the single largest party in the state and they were willing to form the government. He also referred to the 16 May letter written by Yeddyurappa and said that the BJP leader had requested the governor to invite the party to form government and had also said that they would provide a ""stable government"" and they have the ""support of others"". In a historic pre-dawn hearing, the top court had on Thursday cleared the last-minute hurdle created by the Congress-JD(S) combine for the BJP's ambitious surge in southern India by paving the way for Yeddyurappa to be sworn in as the Chief Minister of Karnataka. A specially constituted three-judge bench after more than three hours of hearing, had made it clear that it was not interfering with the governor's decision to invite the saffron party to form government in the state in which BJP with 104 seats has emerged as the single largest party. During the high-voltage hearing, which lasted from 2.11 am to 5.28 am, the top court had made it clear that the swearing-in and government formation would be subject to the final outcome of the case. The court had directed the Centre to place before it two communications sent by Yeddyurappa to the Governor in which he had staked claim to form government, saying their perusal was necessary to decide the case.",FP Staff

Bahl added that it was right for the various budgets across the country to focus on rural areas and said it will be ""dramatic"" if the government gives a 50 percent margin on minimum support price. Jaitley on Thursday announced that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for notified kharif crops will be 1.5 times the input cost – a hike of around five percent over last year. Presenting the Union Budget for 2018-19, Jaitley said the government would spend more on agriculture, livelihood and infrastructure in rural areas, and increase funds for crop insurance, rural roads and irrigation besides setting higher targets for farm credit. With a total budgetary outlay of Rs 2,01,933 crore for agriculture and rural development, the government has emphasised that development of the food processing, dairy and fishery sectors will enhance farmers' income. Bahl pointed out that the proposed Rs 5 lakh hospital insurance to 10 crore households was another important scheme.

" BJP president Amit Shah on Friday asked the party workers to create an environment for a ""massive wave"" in the favour of the saffron party in November's Chhattisgarh Assembly polls so that it will turn into a ""tsunami"" in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He said the government would identify the ""infiltrators"" and throw them out of the country after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retained power in 2019's general election. Shah told the party workers that a thumping victory for the BJP in Chhattisgarh would avenge the ""sacrifices"" of their fellow workers in other states. He was referring to the killings of party leaders and workers in Kerala, West Bengal and other non-BJP-ruled states. Addressing the booth-level BJP workers in Bilaspur town, Shah also hit out at the Congress, accusing it of engaging in the politics of appeasement for votes and doing nothing against ""infiltrators"" who were like ""termites"". ""The BJP is in power in 19 states, covering about 70 percent area of the country. After being in power for three consecutive terms, we are in the battleground to form government for the fourth time in Chhattisgarh,"" he said. Shah asked the BJP workers to set their eyes on winning over 65 of the 90 Assembly seats in Chhattisgarh (the saffron party's tally was 49 in 2013), which will go to the polls in two phases — on 12 and 20 November. ""I want to ask, are you going to be satisfied with a victory margin of two-three seats? This time we should win more than 65 seats. ""Party workers all over the country have their eyes on Chhattisgarh,"" he said, adding that a ""significant"" victory in the state would ensure the party's win in the non-BJP-ruled states. ""My workers in Bengal are keeping an eye on Chhattisgarh. If you win this election with a thin majority, the workers all over the country will be disappointed,"" the BJP chief said. ""Our workers are being killed in Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. Chhattisgarh's victory will form a base for forming governments in Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana. ""Create a massive wave in the state, which will turn into a tsunami in 2019 in the country to ensure victory for (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji,"" he said. Shah said the Chhattisgarh poll results will have a bearing on national politics in 2019. ""(A BJP) victory in Chhattisgarh will lay the foundation for a grand win in 2019. Chhattisgarh's thumping victory will be a revenge of the sacrifices of the party workers in Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala,"" he added. Shah accused the Congress of practising the politics of appeasement for votes and hit out at its president, Rahul Gandhi. ""Every time the Congress came to power in the country, it practised the politics of appeasement for its vote bank at the cost of the country's security. ""I want to ask you, should infiltrators be ousted from the country or not? Illegal infiltrators in crores have entered the country and are eating it like termites. The Congress party did nothing against the infiltrators,"" he said. ""After the BJP came to power in Assam, the NRC (National Register of Citizens) exercise was launched and prima facie, 40 lakh infiltrators were identified. ""As soon as they were identified, Rahul Baba and company, the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Trinamool Congress (TMC), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) -- all of them started raising a hue and cry as if they had lost someone close,"" he said. ""Rahul Baba, you keep on backing them (infiltrators). Let the SP and BSP also take their sides. Nothing will happen. ""After 2019, the Narendra Modi-led BJP government will identify the infiltrators in every corner of the country and drag them out,"" Shah added. He said the country's safety and security as well as making it free from Naxalism, terrorism and infiltrators were among the top priorities of the saffron party. A BJP victory in Chhattisgarh will reflect the support for the NRC and the country's security, and the opposition to infiltrators and Naxalism, Shah added. The BJP is in power in Chhattisgarh for 15 years under the leadership of Chief Minister Raman Singh. In the 2013 Assembly polls, the saffron party had won 49 seats in the state, the Congress 39, the BSP one and an Independent candidate one.",Press Trust of India

A senior AIADMK leader said, ""We have been maintaining a cordial relationship with the Centre. We are against the changes made in the Terms of Reference (ToR) and we have opposed it. We will continue to voice our opposition without joining any other groupings."" A Kerala government official told   that the information they got is that an official delegation from Tamil Nadu would be attending and almost all the Finance Ministers of the southern states, as well as that of Goa, have confirmed participation. He said the conference will discuss on the major issues faced by the southern states over the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission that would determine the share of states in the Central government's tax revenue. The main contention of the Southern states is the usage of 2011 Census data as the reference point as against the 1971 data which would affect the Southern states that had controlled their population in the overall interests of the nation. Meanwhile PMK leader S Ramadoss said Panneerselvam should participate in the conference and register Tamil Nadu's opposition to the ToR.

" Six policemen were injured in Uttar Pradesh during a ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by some upper-caste groups, but life remained largely normal across the state. The bandh was called to protest against the recent amendments to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act by the Parliament to overturn a Supreme Court judgment. Reports from districts across the state said life was by-and-large normal despite the bandh call, officials said here. However, a report from Ballia said BJP MLA from Bairia, Surendra Singh, came out openly in support of the bandh. “Upper-caste people made me the MLA and not Muslims and Dalits. I am ready to sacrifice for the upper caste. If my upper-caste supporters ask me I can also resign (from my seat) for their sake,” Singh said. Some bandh supporters had heated talks with another BJP MLA, Anand Swarup Shukla from Ballia Sadar, who refused to back them. Ballia Superintendent of Police Sriparna Ganguly said some people resorted to brick-batting in which six policemen were injured. Normal life was also affected in Agra. Shops in main markets remained shut and agitators in several parts of the city blocked traffic. The administration has deployed additional security forces to prevent any untoward incidents. Commenting on the strike, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, “It (Bharat Bandh call) has no meaning. People have their feelings. In a democracy everyone has the right to express themselves.” “The BJP government is committed towards the welfare of people and development. We never play politics of caste and religion. The law is to protect the downtrodden. The government will ensure that it will not be misused,” Adityanath told reporters in Gonda, where he had gone to visit flood-hit areas. The Supreme Court had on March 20 ruled out immediate arrests under the Act and suggested a preliminary enquiry to ensure the allegations were not frivolous and to avoid the false implication of innocent persons. It also held that a government official could not be prosecuted under the Act without the sanction of the appointing authority. This decision had triggered nationwide protests by Dalit organisations, forcing the Centre to amend the Act during the Monsoon Session of the Parliament to overrule the SC order.",PTI

": Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the Congress party saying it has ""hoodwinked"" people by just laying foundation stones for projects and has done nothing for the poor.  Speaking at a function organised to start work on the Rs 43,129 crore Barmer oil refinery project, Modi said drought and Congress walk hand-in-hand and the state saw end of drought when the party was shown the door.  Touching on the slugfest between ruling BJP and Congress over credit for the refinery, he said the Congress had only laid foundation stones for projects across the country to claim credit.  Railway lines were announced just to claim short term popularity with projects never ever seeing the light, he said.  Congress, he said, had ""hoodwinked"" people by making just announcements.  Modi said the Congress had seen his commitment to one-rank-one-pension scheme for defence personnel and provided for Rs 500 crore in the interim budget just before the 2014 general elections to claim credit.  ""Barmer refinery was at least on papers, OROP wasn't even on paper,"" he said, adding that no ground work on the beneficiaries or on the outgo was ever done.  It took one-and-half-years to collate the list of beneficiaries of OROP and the implementation cost Rs 12,000 crore as against Rs 500 crore provided by the Congress, he said.  Of this, four installments totalling Rs 10,700 crore have already been made to defence personnel and the rest would also be paid soon, he said.  He said while the Congress just gave the slogan of 'garibi hatao' (remove poverty), the BJP government has worked towards doing so by way of providing free cooking gas (LPG) connection to poor women and giving free power connection to the four crore households that still do not have electricity.  Ahead of the event, ruling BJP and opposition Congress slugged it out to get credit for the refinery.  Congress says its then president Sonia Gandhi had laid oundation stone of the refinery on 22 September, 2013 and Modi was ""re-laying"" the foundation stone.  But both Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Chief Minister Vasundhra Raje said that foundation laying was a political stunt done days before the model code of conduct for assembly elections came into force on 27 September, 2013.  Neither the land was acquired for the project nor the environment clearance obtained for the foundation laying, they said.  Tuesday's function came weeks before by-polls for Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha, and Mandalgarh Assembly seats in Rajasthan on 29 January. The state goes to polls later this year. ",PTI

A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud kept for hearing on April 9 the Central government’s plea after its counsel referred to divergent views of the concerned states on the issue of setting up of the scheme. “We will take this matter on April 9 along with the plea of Tamil Nadu,” the bench said, when the Centre’s counsel Wasim Qadri sought urgent hearing of the plea. The apex court, in its verdict, had asked the Centre to formulate a scheme to ensure compliance of its 465-page judgement on the decades-old Cauvery dispute. It modified the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) award of 2007 and made it clear that it will not be extending time for this on any ground. The apex court had on February 16 raised the 270 tmcft share of Cauvery water for Karnataka by 14.75 tmcft and reduced Tamil Nadu’s share while compensating it by allowing extraction of 10 tmcft groundwater from the river basin, saying the issue of drinking water has to be placed on a “higher pedestal”. With the apex court’s verdict, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Union Territory of Puducherry would be annually entitled to 404.25 tmcft, 284.75 tmcft, 30 tmcft and 7 tmcft of Cauvery water respectively out of the total of 740 tmcft.",PTI
"Putting the onus on the states to check cow vigilantism, the Supreme Court today reserved its verdict on pleas seeking directions to formulate guidelines to curb such violence, saying no one can take law into their hands. A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud said this was a law and order issue and each state has to be responsible. The bench said it will pass an order on the pleas. During the hearing, the bench observed that the instances of vigilantism were actually mob violence, which is a crime. Additional solicitor general P.S. Narasimha said that the Centre was aware of the situation and trying to deal with it. He said the main concern was maintaining law and order. The bench said nobody can take law into their hands and the onus was on the state governments to prevent such incidents.

" West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Monday said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) will be published, on the lines of the one in Assam, if the saffron party was voted to power in the state.

Reacting to Ghosh's remarks, Congress and CPM leaders alleged that the BJP leader's statement reflected the anti-Bengali mindset of the saffron party, which was trying to import the Hindi heartland culture in Bengal. The much-awaited final draft of the NRC was published on Monday in Assam, the only state in the country to have such a document, featuring over 2.89 crore names of the total 3.29 crore applicants in the north-eastern state. ""If we (BJP) are voted to power in Bengal, then we too will implement the NRC in the state. We will send back the illegal immigrants to Bangladesh. Tough days are ahead, we will not tolerate any illegal immigrants in Bengal,"" Ghosh told reporters. Those who will support the illegal immigrants will also be thrown out of the country, he said. ""The NRC in Assam is being implemented following the orders of the court (Supreme Court). It was the Congress, which had proposed the idea of the NRC. Now they are speaking against it,"" Ghosh added. Those whose names were not in the final draft could appeal for rectification, ""but we will never compromise on the security and integrity of our country"", he said. Ghosh came down heavily on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her comments against the NRC in Assam and said she should stop doing vote-bank politics on each and every issue. 
""Those who are inviting illegal immigrants and Rohingyas from the neighbouring country should not talk much about the integrity and security of the country,"" he said.

"Taking their newfound friendship ahead, Samajwadi Party (SP) on 11 April decided to extend support to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on a Legislative Council seat in the upcoming polls while fielding its own candidate on the other seat. The election to 13 seats of the Council will be held on 26 April and counting of votes will take place the same day. To ensure victory, a candidate needs 29 first preference votes and arithmetically, the BJP and its allies are likely to win 11 out of 13 seats comfortably and still be left with five additional votes while the opposition parties can get two seats. In the 100-member UP Legislative Council, the BJP has just 13 members. The Samajwadi Party has 61 members, the BSP nine, the Congress two, the RLD one and others 12. Asked whether this decision was taken to compensate the BSP for its support during the Lok Sabha by-polls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, which the SP wrested from BJP, Chaudhary said: The SP-BSP combine struck gold in the 'saffron' bastion of Gorakhpur – associated with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath –  and Phulpur — earlier represented by his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya in the bypolls. The tenures of 13 MLCs, including SP national president Akhilesh Yadav and two ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government – Mahendra Kumar Singh and Mohsin Raza – will end on 5 May. Of the 13 seats falling vacant, seven were held by the SP, two each by the BJP and the BSP, and one by the RLD. The thirteenth seat was held by former SP minister Ambika Chaudhary.

"Over 28 lakh CBSE board students of class 10 and class 12 will have to retake their Mathematics and Economics papers, in the backdrop of the question paper leak scandal. But what are the chances of the new set of question papers not leaking? And how did leak even happen in the first place? These questions have prompted us to look at the process of making a board exam question paper, and the journey it takes to reach the student – safely and without leakage. The board officials signal red at two stages – one, during the initial printing stage, and two, when it is being picked up from banks where it is stored in sealed boxes. So, did the CBSE officials also know of the leak only when the news became public? Not really. Here’s the Delhi police version of the events that unfolded. The Delhi Crime Branch, which is interrogating the CBSE paper leak, revealed that the board was made aware of the involvement of a coaching centre in Rajinder Nagar as well as two schools in the leakage of papers as early as 23 March by an anonymous source. The board allegedly received a fax, informing them of the alleged suspects, following which the regional office forwarded the complaint to a Police Inspector in the crime branch via WhatsApp – a day later, on 24 March. Speaking to  , a source from the Delhi Police said that immediate action was not taken on the complaint. The next day, CBSE’s Academic Section at Rouse Avenue in New Delhi reportedly received a packet containing answers of Economics paper, and four mobile numbers which could have possibly received the question papers. According to police sources, the crime branch then contacted the owner of the coaching centre in the initial complaint – Vicky Wadhwa – whom they let off after questioning due to the lack of “solid proof”. According to the police, the CBSE went ahead with the Economics exam on 27 March, even after the leakage of the Class 12 paper became “public”. Later, in the evening, the  Crime Branch filed the first FIR in the case. The news of Mathematics paper leaking first broke on social media on 28 March, when the exam was also scheduled. However, 90 minutes after the exam, the Delhi Police filed a second FIR. A day later, on 29 March, Vicky was called in for questioning again. According to police officials, he claimed that his name was “being dragged by his rivals”, and that he too, had received the leaked paper on WhatsApp. A woman tutor who ran a coaching centre in south east Delhi, is also under scanner, police sources told . However, they also added that investigation revealed the students enrolled in Vicky’s coaching centre were recipients of the leaked question paper via Whatsapp. According to police sources, the probe also revealed that papers were even sold, priced between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000. However, police suspect that once money was exchanged, the leaked papers were forwarded to other students, and soon became viral. Therefore, the crime branch revealed that they are trying to trace the original source of the leaked papers. The dates for the re-examination is yet to be announced by the CBSE board.

The state authorities have to intimate the NHRC about existing or proposed mechanisms to the deal with the issue, it said.

""Bihar CM Nitish Kumar should condemn Kant's statement. He should tell people that Niti Aayog is lying to them...

""I was anxious after reading Rohith's mother's statement. Until when will Opposition parties continue politics over it? The family is not financially stable and fake assurance of money was provided to a distressed mother for political purposes. I received information that even Congress president Rahul Gandhi took Rohith's family to various stages (at rallies) and asked them to make statements. His intention should be exposed and it should be checked whether money was offered to the family for doing so. Rahul should apologise for doing petty politics on a pillar of lies,"" Goyal said. However,   that even though ""it's true that the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) promised to provide me with money, but they haven't used me for political gains. It was my wish to speak against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and if needed I will speak again in any of their meeting. The IUML had sent us two cheques of Rs 2.5 lakh out of which one has bounced. We informed them and they said they will directly provide us money so that we can buy a house,"" she said. According to  , Rohith's mother Radhika Vemula had on Monday alleged that even though the family had been promised a house by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), there was no progress on the promise. According to  , she said that the party took them to Kerala and made them participate in a big meeting where the party promised that it would sanction Rs 20 lakh and construct a house for the Vemulas and a site was also identified at Koppuravuru, located between Vijayawada and Guntur, to build the house but nothing happened. Radhika then slammed the IUML for using her as a political pawn. She alleged that the IUML gained good political strength because they had projected her as one of the main guests attending their meetings,   reported. “In such a context, how can use they make promises and use it for political gain?” she remarked. Radhika also claimed that one of the two cheques given to her by the party had bounced, forcing her to make several trips to the bank, the report states. Reacting to the report, BJP spokesperson  , “This is saddening! Politics over the dead. Installments yet to be paid. It seems while some were eyeing for gains over an unfortunate Suicide, Truth was the biggest looser!” Goyal, in his press conference, spoke of these charges by Radhika and said that the Opposition's 'dirty politics' has been exposed by her. ""It is deplorable action by the political parties"", he said. The Indian Union Muslim League made false promises to Rohith's family so that they can address the party's rallies and then they can misrepresent the unfortunate incident. This is condemnable, Goyal said. However, according to media reports the IUML had on Tuesday termed the cheque bounce incident as a clerical mistake. IUML leader MK Muneer told   that the party would stick to its words. “If the IUML has given its word, we will stick to it. I heard the news that a cheque of Rs 20 lakh that was given to Rohith's mother, bounced. This has not come to the notice of any of our leaders yet,"" Muneer said. But later on Tuesday, Radhika denied claiming that the cheque given by IUML had bounced. She instead said that the report was spreading ‘misinformation’.  : “No cheque bounced, it was rejected due to an error. I have no problem with them (IUML). They have given me an advance of Rs five lakh for land and promised me Rs 10 lakh more after Ramzan. I will campaign for anyone who is against the BJP. The article is spreading wrong things.” But Goyal on Wednesday alleged that efforts were made to pressurise the mother to retract her statement and more money was being offered to her in lieu of it.

" Congress president Rahul Gandhi has called a meeting of senior party leaders from Maharashtra on 8 August to discuss the ongoing agitation of the Maratha community for reservation, a party source said on Friday. The meeting will be held in Delhi, said a senior Congress leader in Mumbai. The agitation of the politically influential Maratha community has put the BJP-led state government on the back foot, with protests taking a violent turn in many parts of the state. Many Congress MLAs had announced last week that they would resign from the Assembly to put pressure on the government to accede to the demand. State Congress chief Ashok Chavan had said the decision in this regard would be taken after a discussion with the party's central leadership. The Maratha community constitutes about 30 percent of the state population. Elections to the Maharashtra Assembly are due in 2019.",Press Trust of India
" BJP general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, Muralidhar Rao, on Monday said the party's manifesto would have ""path-breaking"" declarations, and hinted at it having ideas regarding Kannada and culture. He also indicated that there might be a mention about the party's ideas with regard to not subjecting mutts and temples to any kind of government control or ""intimidation."" ""There is people's involvement in manifesto preparation and definitely on four, five issues we will have path-breaking declarations from the party when we come out (with the manifesto),"" Rao said. He was speaking at the ""Meet the Press"" organised by the Press Club of Bengaluru and Reporters Guild. He listed out a comprehensive resolution of farmers' issues, ""radical"" welfare declarations and programmes among the priorities. Rao said ""Karnataka, Kannada and culture, also tourism are inseparable. BJP as a party rooted in cultural aspect feels it has to be a powerful asset in solving issues, so there will be path-breaking ideas from us in this regard."" He accused the Congress and its president Rahul Gandhi of ""half-hearted"" temple visits and called them ""election Hindus"", Rao said. ""BJP will have a completely different view. Not just visiting temples and mutts, but ultimately these mutts and temples should not be subjected to government control, harassment, threats and intimidation.....,"" he said. He referred to the Siddaramaiah government's move to seek public opinion about bringing mutts and temples under its control which was later withdrawn following protests. ""If they (Congress) come again they will do it again. BJP will take a dynamically different view; so mutts and temples and on issues related to culture BJP will have things differently,"" Rao said. The state assembly polls would be a ""watershed election"", and a ""very important one,"" he said. It was not just crucial in the context of the state, but in the context of BJP's onward march, he said. Rao said the party was charged up and motivated to ""expose"" the failures of the Congress. ""... in Karnataka the ground is ready. Both perception wise and feedback from the ground level there is large-scale anti-incumbency against the Congress government,"" he said. For the BJP, anti-incumbency or the failures of the government and its performance would be the central subject, he added. Rao said Siddaramaiah and the Congress had got ""jittery"" and started deviating from issues on realising their performance was not up to mark. ""Whether it is Kannada or state flag or Mahadayi or Lingayat issue, all these are issues on which he (Siddaramaiah) has woken up after four-and-half years...,"" the BJP leader said. For a party that has ruled Karnataka for so long, talking about Kannada, state flag or Lingayat now, would not add credibility to it, he said. Rao said BJP was completely focussed on ""exposing"" the Congress government on its performance and would not allow it to ""side step"" or create a ""non-issue."" Adding to the Congress' performance, ""lack of unity among its leadership and failure to motivate its cadres has added to party's misery,"" he said.",PTI

However, the proceedings were dropped against Jarnail Singh after he resigned as the Rajouri Garden MLA to contest the Punjab Assembly polls in February 2017. In October last year, the EC had issued a notice to the Aam Aadmi Party lawmakers for an explanation.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, 18 February, arrived at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg, outside Lutyens' Bungalow Zone in Delhi to inaugurate the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) new headquarters, where he addressed party workers and senior BJP leaders. The new office is a multi-storeyed modern construction fitted with advanced communication tools. It will enable party office-bearers to co-ordinate official works with their counterparts in the states, ANI reported. The construction of the new headquarters had started in 2017, following the Supreme Court's directive that the party offices should be relocated from the Lutyens' Bungalow Zone. Prime Minister Modi and party chief Amit Shah in 2017 had laid the foundation stone of the new headquarters, and a Mumbai-based architecture company has designed the new headquarters. The prime minister added that democracy was the party's “core value which enables it to take along allies successfully”. The Prime Minister also invoked the legacy of SP Mukherjee and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. “Ours was a journey that began with greats, such as Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya. Generations of workers have given their lives for the party “, he said. BJP Chief Amit Shah said that the dream of “millions of workers” across the country has been fulfilled. Shah said the BJP is on the course of having its own office in almost every district of the country in a year, and noted that the party, at its national executive meeting in 2015, had decided to own an office in 635 of 694 districts in the country, reported PTI.

It should be left to them whether they wish to say ‘Scheduled Caste’ or ‘Dalit’,” he said.

"Juxtaposing the polling pattern in the two regions of Jammu and Kashmir in the state going by the same name on Monday provided an emphatic picture of contrast. While poll booths in Jammu saw voters enthusiastically participating in the electoral exercise for forming new civic bodies, most of their counterparts Kashmir preferred to stay away from the voting kiosks owing to threats from terrorists and separatists despite the extraordinary security cover provided by thousands of security personnel. Notwithstanding the zest shown by voters in Jammu to vote, the indifference in Kashmir towards the democratic process ensured that the voter turnout was a poor one in the urban local body elections when calculated for the whole state in its entirety. About six percent of the electorate voted in the first six hours of polling in 83 wards of urban local bodies in militancy-wracked Kashmir Valley, where elections are being held amid tight security, officials said. Voting for the first of the four-phased elections in the Valley began at 7 am and ended at 4 pm. Polling was brisker in north Kashmir with more than 29 percent of 4,700 voters casting their votes in the first two hours for Kupwara Municipal Committee, followed by 21 percent in Handwara town, the official said. The poll percentage in Bandipora, Baramulla, Anantnag and Budgam municipal areas was around five percent. Polling is being held for only 83 wards in the Valley as 69 wards have been won uncontested. Of the 150 polling stations in the Kashmir division, 138 are categorised hypersensitive. Brisk voting was seen in almost all the wards in Jammu region with Rajouri registering the highest votes while Srinagar in the Valley saw the lowest as a shutdown-call led to subdued polling in the municipal elections that are taking place after 13 years in Jammu and Kashmir. Amid tight security, long queues of enthusiastic voters were seen in almost all the municipal corporation and municipal committee wards in Jammu district where 34 percent polling was recorded in five hours, as Rajouri registered 55 percent and Poonch 47. Voting continued peacefully in Gandhi Nagar, RS Pura, Bishnah, Arnia, Khour, Jurian, Akhnoor, Nowshera, Surankote and Kalakote areas and many other wards. Srinagar registered the lowest count of 3.5 percent in five hours since polling began at 7 am. In the three Srinagar municipal corporation wards of Humhama, Bagh-e-Mehtab and Hamdania colony, 1,001 votes were polled till 11.30 am. In the Ladakh region where biting cold had kept early voters away, saw the process pick up and Kargil district registered 3,470 votes while Leh had 3,164 votes till 11.30 am. A presiding officer was suspended at the Aloosa polling station in Bandipora district for allowing a woman to accompany a voter to the voting counter. Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said no restrictions have been imposed anywhere in the valley although security has been tightened to provide a free and fair environment. No militancy related incident has been reported from anywhere in the valley so far. A mock poll has been conducted at all 584 polling stations. There were defaults in EVMs at four places. Those EVMs were immediately replaced. This time, a large number of independent candidates are also in the fray. This municipal election is also witnessing two significant firsts. In a major development, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are being used for the first time in accordance with the rules that have been amended in 2016. In another first, the ECI is providing voting facilities to Kashmiri migrants by means of postal ballots. Since the migrants continue to be enrolled in their respective assembly constituencies from which the municipal committees or panchayats would derive the rolls, facilities will be provided for them to vote. The urban local body polls were announced in September. Two major political parties — the National Conference and the PDP — have boycotted the elections accusing the Centre of not taking a firm stand on the protection of Article 35A of the Constitution, which is facing a legal challenge in the Supreme Court. Militants have issued threats to anyone participating in these polls, resulting in absence of any campaigning by the candidates. Two National Conference workers were killed last week. In dozens of wards, especially in south Kashmir, no candidate filed nomination papers. Candidates who are contesting have been moved to safe locations and their details have not been made public. All candidates have been provided with either cluster security in hotels or individually in the Valley. In the wake of the polls, mobile internet services have been suspended in South Kashmir, while mobile internet speed has been reduced to 2G in other parts of the Valley. Around 85,000 voters, including 40,800 women, are eligible to vote in the Valley. Of the 30,074 voters in three wards of Srinagar Municipal Corporation, 1,500 turned up to exercise their franchise at the heavily fortified polling stations. Elections are being held in 422 of the state's 1,145 municipal wards.

"The Information and Broadcasting Ministry released Rs 208 crore for the salaries of the employees of Doordarshan and All India Radio (AIR) on 28 February, Prasar Bharati CEO SS Vempati said on Sunday, 4 March. Vempati's remarks came two days after news webite 'The Wire' quoted Prasar Bharati Chairman A Surya Prakash as saying that the public broadcaster had to pay staff salaries for January and February out of its contingency funds as the ministry had not released the funds. Vempati reportedly took to Twitter to clarify that: However, the tweet did not specify the month for which the funds meant for salaries was disbursed by the government. Following The Wire's   on her ""ongoing stand-off with Prasar Bharati,"" I&B minister Smriti Irani has put out a clarification via PIB slamming the report as ""a deliberate, sinister, motivated campaign"". In the clarification, Smriti Irani asserted that the salary funds have not been withheld ""as a retaliation to Prasar Bharati not obeying certain dictates of the ministry"" but because the autonomous body did not sign an MoU with the ministry. The Wire had previously quoted Prasar Bharati Chairman A Surya Prakash in saying that the public broadcaster had to pay staff salaries for January and February out of its contingency funds as the ministry had not released the funds for salary. This was due to a standoff caused by difference between the I&B minister Smriti Irani and Prasar Bharati, The Wire report said. The report also alleged Prasar Bharati will run out of money by April if the standoff continued. However, as reported by The Wire following the original report and the government's reaction, Prasar Bharati souces said that Irani upbraided Prakash for ""leaking"" details of the salary crisis to ""anti nationals."" Although, in order to keep the dispute from escalating, Irani also sought a compromise. Prakash wanted the issue to be taken up by the parliament, the report said. As reported by The Wire, Prasar Bharati sources claimed that even though the General Financial Rules (GFR) governing the disbursal of sanctioned amounts were amended in February 2017 to incorporate a provision for an MoU between all auntonomous bodies which receive over Rs 5 crore annually as budgetary support, and the ministries in charge, there is at the present moment no final draft of the document. This is owing to the fact that there is an ongoing dispute between the minstry and the Prasar Bhartati over its contents. Neither has the PB stopped repeatedly asking for explannation from the ministry about this MoU, claimed the sources, nor has the PB finalised or approved the draft. Prasar Bharati sources also informed The Wire that the MoU, if signed by the broadcaster, would allow Smriti Irani to act as ""super censor"" of content.

": Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be voted back to power in the 2019 general elections, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said emphasising that the Indian leader is addressing basic problems of the common man through flagship schemes of constructing toilets, providing bank accounts and gas connections. Fadnavis is currently visiting the United States following a trip to Canada. After meeting investors and CEOs and attending a community reception in the city, he will visit Washington and San Francisco. “In 2019, people are going to vote Narendra Modi again because what India could not achieve in 67 years, we have achieved a lot in the last four years,” Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told   in an interview in New York on Wednesday. “I won't say that nothing happened in 67 years but the path on which the country has begun its journey now, is something which was never thought of,” he said. Fadnavis said at a time when India is the fastest growing economy in the world, is developing infrastructure and technology, Modi is simultaneously “addressing the problems of a common man.” “We may talk about missions to the moon but even today 50 percent of the population does not have toilets. Look at that disparity. That disparity is being addressed by Modi,” he said. “Unless we address this disparity, it will result in a very divided society.” According to official data, Maharashtra has constructed the maximum number of individual household toilets under the Centre's flagship   Mission scheme, followed by Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Till November last year, as many as 42.72 lakh household toilets have been constructed against the target of 66.42 lakh. Fadnavis said citizens of the country are now getting basic requirements like gas connections and bank accounts. “From providing gas connections to electricity connections, every single step is changing the country and that is why I am very sure that people will vote for Narendra Modi” again in 2019. Asked about the electoral losses suffered by the BJP in the recently held by-elections in Kairana and Noorpur seats in Uttar Pradesh and Bhandara-Gondiya Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra as the country gets ready for the 2019 general elections, Fadnavis said by-elections “cannot be a yardstick since in the by-elections the voting is low.” On the threat letters allegedly by maoists containing a plot to target Modi, Fadnavis said the letter have been recovered from a hard disk and there is other “corroborating evidence” that an assassination attempt was being planned against Modi. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had said the BJP was playing a ""threat letter card"" to gain sympathy. Fadnavis reiterated that it was “very unfortunate” when senior leaders like Pawar make such comments. “With all the damaging evidence, if somebody says that it is a letter to get sympathy, I don't expect that from such a person,” he said.",Press Trust of India
"A day before the Niti Aayog meeting, four non-BJP Chief Ministers extended their support to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s sit-in protest at the Lt Governor’s office, saying there is a “constitutional crisis” in the state and they will urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to solve the issue at the earliest. The chief ministers – West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan, Karnataka’s HD Kumaraswamy and Andhra Pradesh’s N Chandrababu Naidu – also accused the Central government of “restricting the federal system”, terming it a threat to the nation. They also said they were denied permission to meet Kejriwal and Lt Governor Anil Baijal even after having waited for long, asking how was it possible in a democracy. Speaking at a joint press conference with Vijayan, Kumaraswamy and Naidu, Banerjee said: To show solidarity to Kejriwal’s protest demanding IAS officers to end their non-cooperation with his government, the four chief ministers visited Kejriwal’s residence, where they met his wife and other members of his family. “We have come here to show solidarity with Kejriwal. Politics is there in its own place,” they said. “Because of the attitude of Central government this has happened. The Centre is restricting the federal system which is a threat to the nation. Everyone is with him (Kejriwal). All the democratic people are with Delhi chief minister,” Vijayan said. “The LG is the appointed leader, if not his, then whose doors will one go and knock? They should have solved the matter among themselves. Why did it take so long?"" she asked and pointed out that the Lt Governor did not meet Kejriwal, who has been on protest for six days, for even six minutes. The four chief ministers, who had met here to discuss the issue, also wrote a joint letter to Baijal seeking to meet Kejriwal but were again verbally denied on the pretext that Baijal is out. In the evening, Banerjee attended a meeting at Andhra Bhawan with her counterparts Vijayan, Kumaraswamy and Naidu. The four chief ministers met shortly after Baijal declined permission to Banerjee to meet Kejriwal. She had planned to go to the protest site – Lt Governor's residential office – along with Naidu. Informed sources said the four were planning a strategy on how to strengthen Kejriwal’s hands. Kejriwal, along with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Cabinet ministers Satyendar Jain and Gopal Rai, is camping at Raj Niwas since Monday demanding a direction to the IAS officers working in the Delhi administration to end their undeclared strike. He also wants the central government to approve his government's proposal to deliver ration to the poor at their houses. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

"The first phase of urban local body (ULB) polls begin in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, but many here are ""clueless"" about the exercise with most of them complaining about not knowing their candidates or even when to vote. As many as 584 polling stations will be set up in Jammu where the first phase of the four-phased local body elections will take place on 8 October, officials said on Saturday. A total of 4,42,159 electorate will vote to elect their representatives among 743 candidates at 584 polling stations including 505 polling stations for municipal corporation Jammu and 79 for municipal committees, district election officer, Ramesh Kumar told reporters in Jammu. Shoaib Ahmad, a resident of Srinagar from an uptown locality, said people in his ward do not know who the candidates are this time. The summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is going to vote in the first phase. ""Ask anyone here if they know who the candidates are. Everyone will tell you, they have no idea. There is too much secrecy,” Ahmad, who works in a private company, said. He alleged the government was only interested in ""showing"" that an election was held, but not with the conduct of the polls in a proper manner. While 447 candidates are in the fray for the 75 wards of municipal corporation Jammu, 296 candidates are trying their luck in the 79 wards of seven municipal committees. A total of 422 wards spread over various districts of Jammu and Kashmir are going to polls in the first phase. A police official said the prevailing situation in Kashmir does not allow candidates to campaign openly as there is a threat to their lives. While separatists have called for a boycott of the polls, militants have threatened to target persons taking part in these elections. ""The candidates have been given security and most of them have been taken to secure locations, but the situation is such they cannot campaign. The threat is not only from militants, but from mobs as well,"" the official said. The complains of not knowing the candidates were not limited to the city. People in many other areas of the valley expressed ignorance regarding the details of the polls in their wards. Ishfaq Ahmad, a resident of Ganderbal, which is voting in the last phase on 16 October, said such is the level of secrecy that people are joking that only the candidates themselves know they are standing in the elections. ""We have no idea who is contesting from our ward. There has been no campaign or door-to-door canvassing by anyone so far. Even the government has not put the details of the candidates on the election commission website. There are simply no details anywhere. Only the candidate would know that he is contesting. Perhaps, even their family does not, such is the secrecy,” he said. He said ""most of the people would boycott the polls"", but relatives and friends of the candidates would exercise their franchise. Another potential voter here, Khalid said he was earlier excited about voting but now he believes the polls should be put on hold till there is an improvement in the situation. ""The government says the situation does not permit them to provide details of candidates. In that case, they should have delayed the polls till there was some improvement. I was excited to vote, especially since EVMs were introduced. However, I do not have essential details for voting, so how and why will I vote?"" he asked. Apart from the secrecy regarding candidates, people in some areas of the city here do not know when to vote. ""Forget about who is contesting, we do not even know when is voting taking place in our area,"" Ghulam Qadir, a resident of Sekidafar area in the city said. He said he has seen many elections, but ""nothing like this has ever happened"". ""People are clueless on the date of voting. The government should have advertised in newspapers with poll details on a phase-basis. Most of the people here do not know their ward numbers. Nothing like this has ever happened,"" Qadir said. A senior Congress leader said the atmosphere in the state was not conducive for polls, but the party decided to contest after the Centre ""forced"" the elections on the people. ""This is the most low profile election in the history of the state.  We have not seen anything like this. The atmosphere was not conducive for the polls, but it was thrust on us by the Centre,"" he said. The Congress leader said the secrecy maintained by the administration over the whole process has cast a shadow over the exercise. ""We have received complaints of people not knowing who is in the fray. See, the candidates have been taken to secure locations and virtually put under house arrest.

"India’s former chief election commissioner Dr S Y Quraishi said India’s electronic voting machines are “totally dependable” because they don’t form part of a “connected” ecosystem unlike the “far more dangerous” smartphones in our pockets. ""No regime could have changed if these machines could have been manipulated"", Quraishi said   at the UN headquarters in New York City. Quraishi and Nepal’s election commissioner Ila Sharma spoke at the New York event. Quraishi, a 1971 batch IAS officer, was India’s CEC from 2010 to 2012. His book ’An Undocumented Wonder - the making of the great Indian election’ came out in 2014. Looking ahead to 2019, Quraishi said the next general election is likely to see more aggressive politics which means implementing the model code will become increasingly difficult for the EC. Social media mischief will rise, says Quraishi, despite platforms like Facebook being reined in the embarrasment of an epic privacy scandal. Quraishi, on a speaking tour in the US, has said often that any worry about security of Election Commission of India (ECI) data is “unnecessary”. “Questions have been raised if linking the ECI’s data with Aadhaar will compromise privacy and security. There, too, my answer is no. The only objective of linking ECI with Aadhaar is to detect duplicate voters — a major concern. Biometrics will involve checking impersonation only,” Quraishi wrote in  Takeaways from former CEC Quraishi’s thoughts on the world’s most outsize election, barely 12 months away. 
“The Indian general election is often referred to as one of the biggest elections. That is not accurate. It is the world’s biggest election. The 2014 election was the largest in world history. At last count, we had 834 million voters of which 554 million voted. We have 11 million polling staff. You may find it hard to belive that they are neutral but we don’t trust anybody except our government officials.” 
“We are a mini world. We have almost every religion, 22 official languages, 200 developed languages, 2000 dialects…We have deserts, deep forests, snow covered mountains. We have to address that diversity effectively. Inclusion is a key word for the Election Commission. Everybody is a minority in India. Hindus are a majority across the country but are a minority in Kashmir.” 
“It took 144 years for the USA to give women the right to vote. India, at that time a poor country, gave women equal voting rights from Day One. It may not sound like a big deal today but it is.”

" Shiv Kumar Maurya Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday, 12 November, said at an event in Delhi, that it's because of Nehru's institutional structures that even a   could aspire to, and eventually become the prime minister of the country. Tharoor was speaking, on the eve of Nehru’s 129th birth anniversary, at the re-launch of his 2003 book –  . UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi delivered the inaugural address, in which she invoked the values of Nehru, spoke of his legacy and the ‘efforts by the ruling BJP government’ to undermine that legacy. Praising Nehru's institutional values, Tharoor said that Nehru believed in democracy despite it being the toughest choice, given the state of the country after Partition. “It would have been easy to say, ‘We need a firm hand, democracy is not an option.’ But Nehru never considered this an option,” Tharoor stated. Tharoor also said that Nehru was always open to criticism, whether it came from the Opposition or his own party. “Shankar, a famous cartoonist back then, used to regularly poke fun at Nehru... Nehru took it all,” Tharoor added. Commenting on Nehru’s views on religion, Tharoor said that while Nehru didn’t care for religion, he also didn’t speak one unsavoury word against a religious group or community. “He was also not particularly religious. We have to accept the fact that the well springs of Nehruvian secularism did lie in agnosticism,” he said. “It was not that he disrespected religion, but he had no time for the professed leaders. In one of the letters that I quoted, he said he has no patience for mullahs and maulavis or sadhus and sants and that they don’t have answers to all the problems of the nation. That is an interesting thing because while that was very much his personal proclivity, he never imposed that on a nation which is very deeply steeped in religion,” Tharoor said. BJP Hits Back In a rather sarcastic tweet, the BJP on Wednesday, 12 November said that Nehru was the sole reason humanity exists. “Minor correction Dr. Tharoor, Nehru is the sole reason why humanity exists. Don’t trivialise his role to mundane matters like making Prime Ministers and all that ,” the tweet read. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the Congress cannot look beyond one family or recall the contribution of others to the country. Javadekar said the Congress talked only about one family and never mentioned the likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The opposition party wanted to restrict historical references to one family, he added.

" The Delhi Congress on Friday criticised the police for entering Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence for collecting evidence in connection with the alleged attack on Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash, calling it an ""undemocratic"" move. A large number of Delhi Police personnel on Friday descended at Kejriwal's residence to examine the CCTV surveillance system in connection with their investigation following the ""attack"" on Prakash during a meeting there on Monday night. ""It is unfortunate and undemocratic that the police entered the house of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal,"" said former Delhi Congress president Arvinder Singh Lovely. Lovely had returned to the Congress last week, months after he joined the BJP, where he said he was an ""ideological misfit"". He also criticised the Aam Aadmi Party over the alleged attack on Prakash by its MLAs. The ""real face"" of the AAP has been exposed after the chief minister's adviser VK Jain gave a statement to the police admitting that Prakash was manhandled, Lovely said. ""AAP leaders were saying that no manhandling happened... but the real face of the party has been exposed before the people after Jain's statement,"" he said. Jain has told the police that he saw AAP MLAs Prakash Jarwal and Amanutullah Khan assaulting the senior bureaucrat. He had previously said he had not seen anything as he had gone to the washroom at the time of the incident on Monday night. Lovely claimed that the people of Delhi are confused now as to whether they have elected AAP for development or for incidents like the one that allegedly happened with Prakash.

"With the final Independence Day speech of his term as prime minister around the corner, Narendra Modi gave interviews to two news organisation that were published on the weekend In the interviews to   and  , Modi spoke about key subjects such as job creation, the economy, Assam’s National Register of Citizens and the 2019 general elections. The prime minister condemned incidents of lynching and mob violence, which critics have accused his government of encouraging. He also said that his government was taking steps to engage with digital media platforms to prevent fake news.  Here are the main takeaways from the interviews. Modi and his government have been routinely criticised for failing to create more jobs. That criticism seemed to obliquely come from within the government too. For instance, Union minister Nitin Gadkari, in reference to the Maratha protests in Maharashtra to demand quotas in government jobs for the community,   on August 4, “Let us assume the reservation is given. But there are no jobs. Because in banks, the jobs have shrunk because of IT. The government recruitment is frozen. Where are the jobs?” Modi’s stock answer to the unemployment question – since a television interview in January in which he suggested that selling pakodas counts as being employed – is that the problem is not a lack of jobs but a lack of data about jobs. In other words, one should trust his government that there are jobs, it is just that there is no data to prove this.  In the interview to  , he repeated this assertion: “Rather than the so-called failure of this government to create jobs, I believe the shortcoming lies in the absence or lack of streamlining of jobs. Naturally, in the absence of information, our opponents will exploit this situation and blame us for not creating jobs... “If you look at claims made by state governments – Bengal says it created 68 lakh jobs and the previous Karnataka government claimed it created 53 lakh jobs. Are we saying that all the country’s jobs are being created in some states and that other states and the country as a whole, are not creating jobs? This propaganda on jobs by the Opposition is nothing but a political gimmick.” The Modi government has been accused of encouraging mob violence, especially attacks on Muslims and Dalits by cow protection vigilantes. While some ministers have on occasion decried such violence, incidents like that of a Union minister   have added to this perception. Modi’s response has been to say that such incidents should not be politicised. This is what he told ANI too:  “It would be a great travesty to reduce these incidents to mere statistics and then indulge in politics over them. That shows a kind of perverse mindset that looks at violence and criminality as something to be milked, instead of unitedly opposing. Even a single incident is one too many and deeply unfortunate. Everyone should rise above politics to ensure peace and unity in our society. My party and I have spoken in clear words, on multiple occasions against such actions and such a mindset. It is all on record. Also, we are people who go beyond just words. Look at the actions of our Home Ministry to see how we have acted against violence.” As before, Modi – who once dismissed journalists as “news traders” – did not offer a full-throated condemnation of fake news but said that the most effective solution for it is “self-realisation” and “self-restraint”.  He told  : “As individuals, we all must know the dos and don’ts of social interactions. The moment a person decides ‘these are the lines I won’t cross, come what may’, then I am sure all aspects will be taken care of. “Digital media stands for equality and furthers the spirit of freedom of expression. It is a bastion of free speech and creative expression. There was a time when one had to be ‘eminent’ to be heard. Digital media has changed that. The power of one Facebook post, tweet or Instagram story is immense.” Assam’s National Register of Citizens – an exercise in drawing up a list of Indian citizens in the state, separating them from undocumented migrants – was the subject of much debate during the monsoon session of Parliament that concluded last week. There was an outcry after four million names were left out of the final draft, which was published on July 30.   While the Bharatiya Janata Party maintained this was an important exercise   Bangladeshi infiltrators Opposition politicians such as Mamata Banerjee, Rahul Gandhi and Mayawati were critical of the exercise. In the interviews, the prime minister accused the Opposition of playing “vote bank politics” and maintained that the Congress lacked the “political will and courage” to implement the National Register of Citizens. He told  : “I am sure all Indians will agree that sovereignty and citizenship are essential aspects of any nation. Those unnecessarily raising controversies need to realise the genuineness of this exercise and that is monitored by the Supreme Court. It is ironic that our opponents who do not have faith in the CJI [chief justice of India] now don’t even have a faith in a Supreme Court-monitored exercise. It is only an issue of national interest. There is no place for politics when it comes to national interest.” In the interview to ANI, Modi said: “Only those who have lost faith in themselves, fear loss of popular support and lack faith in our institutions can use words like ‘civil war’, ‘blood bath’ and ‘desh ke tukde tukde’. Evidently, they are disconnected from the pulse of the nation. As far as Mamataji’s stand is concerned, she should remember what she said on the floor of the Parliament in 2005. Was that Mamataji correct or is this Mamataji correct? The Congress is also playing politics over the NRC [National Register of Citizens].” The prime minister was referring to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s contention that Assam’s National Register of Citizens would lead to “civil war and bloodbath”, and to her   in 2005 when she reportedly sought a discussion on the subject of undocumented immigrants in West Bengal.  With the general elections a year away, Modi and the BJP have been dismissive of Opposition efforts to form a mahagathbandhan or grand alliance. In the interviews, too, the prime minister exuded confidence of his party retaining power. Modi told ANI: “Let us understand the true character of the mahagathbandhan. The mahagathbandhan is for personal survival, not for ideological support. The mahagathbandhan is for personal ambitions, not for people’s aspirations. The mahagathbandhan is purely about power politics, not about people’s mandate. The mahagathbandhan is about dynasties, not about development. The mahagathbandhan is not about any union of minds or ideas, but about rank opportunism. The only question is whether they will break up before the election or after!” Rejecting the Opposition alliance as a “non-ideological alliance of desperate and disparate groups”, he told  :  “I am very confident that my party will continue to get the love and affection of the people as we have received in the past four years. We will definitely get more seats than we got the last time and I am confident that we will break all records of the seats won by NDA [the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance] in the past and achieve greater glory. The people are with us and we have nothing to fear.” In both interviews, Modi spent some time talking about the Goods and Services Tax – one of two major financial policies of his government that are likely to define his term in office. But he was conspicuously silent on the other policy: demonetisation, the government’s decision in November 2016 to withdraw 86% of the currency in circulation and replace it with new notes, ostensibly in an attempt to root out black money. This was meant to be a major policy effort for the Modi government. But in the face of a barrage of criticism, demonetisation has not been a major part of the BJP’s political rhetoric of late. In   interview, this question seemed to give the prime minister an opportunity to speak about the policy: “What are government’s three initiatives/achievements that have brought you the greatest satisfaction? What are the three things you wished you could have done better?” However, Modi chose not to give a definitive answer, only saying: “All my government’s steps since we came to power have been taken with passion and commitment. Singling out favourites that provide, as you say, ‘greatest satisfaction’ would be unfair and not in keeping with this government’s policy. We are working towards a vision for New India and taking initiatives for the same. To sit and ponder on the success of past initiatives would take away precious time that can be dedicated to new ones.”",Scroll Staff

The Congress leader said Modi was the prime minister of the entire country and not only of the BJP. He said Modi had ""less knowledge of history and writes his own history"". Modi needs to be reminded that Congress presidents such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Maulana Azad were iconic leaders, he said. ""It will be better if he keeps a list of Congress presidents in his office. Maybe then he will leave his habit of giving wrong statements,"" Sharma said. The Congress, he said, was a party ""for all Indians and respects the diversity the country has to offer"". He also said the Congress was against triple talaq and the prime minister should know that there were some rules and regulations that need to be followed in Parliament. ""This government has tried time and again to bypass Parliament. They want to get bills approved without the scrutiny of Parliament,"" he alleged. The prime minister had yesterday said the opposition was stonewalling the government's efforts to secure the life of women, especially Muslim women. The triple talaq bill has already been passed in the Lower House, but remains pending in the Rajya Sabha amid Opposition reservations over it. Sharma alleged that the prime minister was a ""peddler of untruths"". Instead of giving an account of the last four years, ""the prime minister is resorting to untruths, half-truth and lies"", he alleged. ""The Congress does not need any certificate from Narendra Modi or the BJP about its credentials, ideologies or credibility and commitment to the country. It is very well documented,"" he said. 
Sharma also said that he can understand the prime minister's helplessness as he belonged to an ideology, the followers of which had even opposed Mahatma Gandhi. The Congress also alleged the Modi government provided false data about the upliftment of people from below poverty line. The prime minister's claim that five crore people have been lifted out of poverty in two years was ""laughable"", Sharma said. In fact, after demonetisation and the launch of the GST, crores of people have been thrown below the poverty line, he added. The Congress leader claimed that 14 crore people were lifted out of the poverty net from 2004 to 2014.",Press Trust of India
": Rejecting Congress leader CP Joshi's apology for his casteist remarks, the BJP on Friday said party president Rahul Gandhi must take responsibility and express regret. Stressing that Joshi had ""insulted the Indian culture as well as the Hindu religion"", Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of ""dividing every religion for power"". ""The statement of Congress leader (Joshi) is baseless, wrong and condemnable. It reflects that the Congress doesn't know the history of Indian culture and Hindu religion,"" Trivedi said at a press conference in Jaipur. Congress talks about politics of development but divides the society on the basis of caste and religion... The party has divided every religion for power and such negative outlook has no place in politics, he added. Addressing a poll meeting in Rajasthan on Thursday, Joshi had reportedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP MP Uma Bharti and Hindu activist Sadhvi Ritambhara were from ""lower castes"" and therefore, know nothing of Hinduism. He said it is the Brahmins who were learned and know of Hinduism. As the statement caused a political furore, Rahul Gandhi on Friday clarified that the Congress leader's statement did not reflect the ideals of the party, and urged the senior leader to apologise. Joshi, a candidate in the 7 December assembly polls in Rajasthan, duly apologised in a tweet. ""Respecting the Congress principles and feelings of party workers, I regret for my statement if it had hurt any section of the society,"" Joshi tweeted. However, an unimpressed BJP asked the Gandhi scion to apologise. ""We don't want his (Joshi) apology... Rahul Gandhi should take responsibility and apologise for the remarks,"" Trivedi said. The BJP leader further accused the Congress of not only dividing the society but also the resources of the country.

"The alliance between the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra has run into more trouble, this time over the contentious Nanar refinery project, a 15,000-acre undertaking planned in Nanar village of Ratnagiri district in coastal Konkan region. It is around 350 kilometres away from Mumbai. However, the Sena isn't too happy with things. A strongly worded editorial in the party's mouthpiece   compared the relationship between the two allies as ""post-divorce"". ""Though the state government is running on Sena's support, it is living a post-divorce life. The Maharashtra government is one of the best examples of how to be together, clearly under coercion, and maintain the 'alliance' even when there is no correspondence with each other"", it said. The Sena said   in the coastal village. ""Mango and jackfruit crops will be destroyed. The sea will get polluted affecting the quality of the fish"", the article argued further, adding that the Konkan region is in a scenic part of Maharashtra. Party leader Sanjay Raut, who pens the editorials, likened the project to the Ram Temple being destroyed in Ayodhya and a temple of Ravana being erected in its place. Raut also accused Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis of reneging on his promise that the Nanar project would not continue if locals were opposed to it. ""Gujaratis and Marwaris are buying up land in and around Nanar"", he said, while adding, ""The dust of confusion is everywhere in the state. The government has lost itself in the dust"". Industries Minister Subhash Desai even cancelled the land acquisition notification, but Fadnavis then expressed his anger at this and said the order shouldn't have been cancelled. A consortium of oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) — signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop and build a refinery and petrochemicals complex, called the Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited. The refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (60 million metric tonnes per annum) and also produce refined petroleum products including petrol and diesel meeting the BS-VI fuel efficiency norms. It's also important that the refinery be located at the precise location chosen because there is a port nearby and will be used for transporting the oil. Fadnavis appeared to say as much when he shot down a proposal to shift the refinery to Vidarbha. ""Proposed refinery project at Nanar needs sea near the project. It is not an inland project and hence it is highly impossible to shift it to Vidarbha"", Fadnavis was quoted as saying in  . ""This is a central government project. The oil will be carried through underground pipelines under sea. There is no financial provision to lay pipelines on the ground and stretch it up to Vidarbha, and hence it will be set up in Konkan region only"", he added.",FP Staff
" Once a formidable force in Bengal politics, the CPM is now just a shadow of its past as it struggles to hold on to its ground, with the BJP fast replacing it as the main opposition to the ruling TMC. The CPM-led Left Front, known as the main architect of the Panchayati Raj system since its inception in 1978, used to register hands down victory in most of the zila parishads 
of the state. But this time, it has been struggling to find candidates to file nominations in several seats. ""It is true that in most of the places, we have not been able to file nominations. One of the reasons is violence by the Trinamool Congress, but there are several places where we had a tough time in finding candidates,"" a senior CPM leader said on the condition of anonymity. According to the list of nominations filed by various parties for the panchayat polls, the TMC is way ahead of its rivals in all the three segments of the panchayat polls — gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zila parishad. But tothe  utter surprise of several political observers, the BJP outnumbered the Congress and the CPM to emerge as the second largest party after the ruling TMC in the number of nominations filed for the upcoming panchayat polls. The Left leadership does not have a proper explanation about the BJP filing more nominations than them except the theory of a ""tacit understanding between BJP and TMC"". CPM politburo member and MP Mohammed Salim said the number of party candidates should not be measured only in terms of nominations filed, as the CPM is fighting as a Left Front constituent and in several seats it has extended support to secular and democratic independent candidates. But several top CPM leaders agreed that the party needs to stop living in denial by coming up with ""lame excuses of tacit understanding between the BJP and the TMC"" and pull up its socks to ensure that the BJP does not replace the Left as the main Opposition in the state. ""We have lost our mass base, our vote share has decreased. But instead of fixing it, we are blaming others. We should learn lessons before it is too late. Time is running out,"" a senior CPM leader said. A few days back, former chief minister and senior CPM leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharya had called for defeating the TMC and the BJP in the rural polls. Another leader said it did not send the right message to the people that the top brass of the state unit was busy debating the party's political line at the Hyderabad Party Congress when the cadres faced the heat to file nominations. The single phase polls will be held at 48,650 seats in 3,358 gram panchayats, 9,217 seats in 341 panchayat samitis and 825 seats in 20 zila parishads on 14 May. The TMC has filed 1,000 nominations for the zila parishads, followed by the BJP with 782 nominations. The CPM and the Congress have filed 537 and 407 nominations respectively after scrutiny. For the panchayat samitis, the TMC has filed 12,590 nominations, followed again by the BJP, which has filed 6,149 nominations. The figures for the CPM and the Congress are 4,400 and 1,740 respectively after scrutiny. The picture is the same in the case of gram panchayats for which the TMC has filed 58,978 nominations, BJP 27,935, CPM 17,319 and the Congress 7,313 respectively. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the figures state that the BJP has emerged as the only alternative to ""the TMC's misrule in the state. The Left is a spent force"". TMC Secretary General Partha Chatterjee said the party is not bothered about the BJP's rise and said the Left should decide whether they are serious about fighting the BJP or not. ""On one hand, the CPM is saying it is against the BJP while on the other hand, we are seeing that CPM cadres are joining the BJP to fight us.

"It is being called the   before the grand final that is the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2018, three major BJP-ruled states will go to the polls: Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh. With 230 Assembly seats and 29 Lok Sabha seats up for grabs, Madhya Pradesh, which  , is perhaps the most important of all. With three consecutive victories, the challenge before the ruling BJP maintaining its winning streak while contending with the anti-incumbency factor both at the state (13 years of Shivraj Singh Chouhan rule) and the Centre (four years of Narendra Modi government). Further complicating matters is the Congress, resurgent under its new chief Rahul Gandhi, which may pose a stiff challenge to the Narendra Modi - Amit Shah juggernaut. Here is a rundown of the state politics ahead of the Assembly election: With a population of 7.2 crore, Madhya Pradesh is India's fifth most populous state. It is divided into seven major regions: Malwa, Bundelkhand, Baghelkhand, Nimar, Mahakoshal, Chambal and Gird. According to the  , only 28 percent of the population lived in the urban areas. In 2001, the state's sex ratio was 919, but improved 12 points by 2011 to reach 931. The literacy rate in Madhya Pradesh stood at 70 percent, according to 2011 census, which was lower than the national average of 74 percent. Around 91 percent of the population in the state were Hindus, while less than seven percent identified as Muslims. With a population of over 15.31 million, Madhya Pradesh has the largest tribal population in India. At least 19 out of the 50 districts are tribal-dominated. Schedule Castes constitute 21.6 percent of the total population, while Other Backward Castes (OBCs) form over 51 percent of the population. Madhya Pradesh is largely a rural state. Crop failure in 2017 only exacerbated the farmer crisis. The issue grabbed national headlines last June after farmers protest turned violent in Mandsaur. , Madhya Pradesh farmers — like their counterparts in Gujarat and Rajasthan — have been facing the problem of low prices for crops and interference of commission agents According to a   report, about one-tenth of the farmer suicides in the past 16 years took place between 2016 and 2017. With a farm loan waiver not in sight, a report in   stated that BJP’s failure to resolve the crisis may hit its rural vote bank. The bureaucracy is plagued by corruption. The scam in Vyapam (a board which selects candidates for government posts through competitive exams), which was uncovered in 2013, exposed the bureaucratic rot. A   (also unearthed in 2013) threatened to also drag the chief minister into a Lokayukta investigation. The Congress   that corruption is at its ""peak"" in Madhya Pradesh. The Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ajay Singh claimed that multi-crore scams surfaced during the Shivraj regime. An article in   stated that corruption in Vyapam highlighted the deeper crisis in Madhya Pradesh’s education and medical sector. As an article in   noted, “a section of the bureaucrats is protecting and promoting the corrupt”. The report quoted a senior journalist as saying that the issue of corruption may end up helping Congress win. The number of educated unemployed youth is rising. As per the 2017 economic survey report, at least 14.1 lakh youth are unemployed, of which nearly 12.9 lakh are educated. “The percentage of educated unemployed increased from 79.60 percent in 2015 to 85.74 percent by the end of December 2016,"" a senior official told  This despite the fact that there was a s  (10 per cent to 2.7 percent) in the overall unemployment numbers between 2016 and early 2017. Drought in 2016 and 2017 may hurt BJP in rural areas. Poor rain in recent years led to water scarcity. According to  , water crisis reached severe levels in Jabalpur, Indore, Ujjain, and Sagar divisions in April 2017. Worse, deficient rains in 31 districts during the 2017 monsoon season forced the government to declare Like in neighbouring Gujarat, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, BJP and the Congress dominate. The BJP has been winning Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections since 2003. It also ruled the state between 1990 and 1992 with Sunderlal Patwa as chief minister. Through Congress has been out of power since 2003, it has been a political force since the formation of Madhya Pradesh in 1956. Barring the period between 1967 and 1969, and the Janata Party interregnum, the party enjoyed uninterrupted power. Several key leaders of the Congress on the national stage began their political careers in the state. These include Vidya Charan Shukla, Madhavrao Scindia, Arjun Singh, Motilal Vora, Digvijaya Singh and Kamal Nath. Parties such as BSP and Samajwadi Party, which are strong in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, have a marginal presence. Electoral arithmetic changed considerably in 2000, when Chhattisgarh was carved from Madhya Pradesh's tribal-dominated districts. Prior to the formation of the new state, Madhya Pradesh had 320 Assembly and 40 Lok Sabha seats.      Seat share Vote share The year 2003 saw the first Assembly election after the state's bifurcation. That year, the BJP came to power for the second time in the state's history. While the BJP won 173 seats, the Congress won only 38. In the 2008 elections, Congress nearly doubled its seat tally from 38 to 71 seats. Nevertheless, BJP won the election with a reduced majority in the Assembly. In the last election, BJP continued its winning run, registering victories in 165 Assembly seats. The 2013 election was also significant in the matter of vote share. Unlike 2003 and 2008 elections, when the difference in the vote share of the two parties did not exceed six percent, the last election saw the BJP pull away by nearly eight percent. 
 The three-time chief minister and the OBC face of the BJP is likely to fight for his fourth consecutive term. He is already the longest serving chief minister of the state. However, several reports of his imminent departure from state politics have been making the rounds after  the swearing-in ceremony of Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani. A six-time MLA and former cabinet minister, Vijayvargiya is currently a national general secretary of the BJP. He is also   a Shivraj rival and a favourite of BJP president Amit Shah. He is also   to take over as the party unit chief in the upcoming organisational restructuring. The Lok Sabha MP from Guna and a former Union minister is being considered a prospective chief ministerial face of the Congress party. Congress recent win in the Chitrakoot Assembly by-election under his leadership   rejuvenated the party ahead of the Assembly elections. While he has the  senior leader Kamal Nath, infighting within the party may be major cause for worry. The two-time chief minister is currently undertaking the 3,000-kilometre long Narmada Yatra. Though he maintains that it is a spiritual yatra, reports claim that his journey will cover at least 100 Assembly seats. According to  , Digvijaya is using the yatra as a platform to reconnect with his core electorate in the run-up to the November-December polls.",FP Staff

Trump said the 2015 agreement, which included Germany, France and Britain, was a “horrible one-sided deal that should never ever have been made.” He added that the United States “will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction.” Trump’s decision means Iran’s government must now decide whether to follow the U.S. and withdraw or try to salvage what’s left of the deal.

After entering the premises, the commandoes locked the main gate of the premises from inside, preventing entry of media-persons and a number of other curious onlookers. The CBI team is understood to have inspected the shelter home, after getting its seal opened, and collected documents and other items it found to be of value in the investigation. The CBI team is also understood to have interrogated Thakur’s son Rahul Anand, in whose name the Hindi daily is registered and who holds the post of its editor. CBI sleuths, accompanied by forensic experts, also inspected the courtyard, which was dug up last month by the police, following allegations by inmates that one of the girls was beaten to death by staff members of the shelter home a few years ago and her body was buried at the spot. Nothing incriminating was found after the day-long excavation and the eight-feet-deep pit was again filled up. However, the CBI appeared to be in for a second look as heavy earth mover machines have been summoned. The Bihar government has cancelled the registration of the NGO Seva Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti, which ran the shelter home for destitute girls. The possibility of sexual exploitation of the girls at the shelter was first highlighted in an audit report by Tata Institute of Social Sciences, submitted to the state social welfare department in April. Medical examination of the girls later confirmed that 34, of the total 42, were sexually abused. The FIR in the case was registered on May 31 against 11 people, including Thakur. On July 26, the Bihar government recommended a CBI inquiry in the matter.",PTI

"Barely weeks after news broke of the PNB-Nirav Modi scam, the Income Tax Department has initiated legal action against 447 companies, for allegedly committing tax fraud to the tune of Rs 3,200 crore, the   on 5 March. The report states that the I-T cell has pulled up companies for deducting tax from their employees, but failing to deposit the same with the Government, instead, diverting the funds to their businesses. The  report states that the income tax department has initiated prosecution against these companies, with a number of warrants being issued for offences under the Income Tax Act committed in the financial year 2017-2018. The report adds that action has been initiated for offences under Section 276 B of the I-T Act. The  report adds, citing sources, that the Income Tax department was contemplating adding criminal breach of trust, and cheating to the list of offences, since the alleged act amounts to duping employees, and diverting funds. The report adds that a majority of offenders are builders and building contractors, with others including film production houses, start-ups, and a number of “companies” that were functional for less than six months. The report, again citing sources, goes on to allege that an infrastructure company that works in port development had diverted Rs 14 crore, and another firm, an IT-solutions MNC, had failed to deposit Rs 11 crore it had deducted from employees as tax. The report adds that the Income Tax Department had initiated action for recovery, by attaching the movable and immovable assets of the companies, along with the bank accounts of the alleged offenders.

"Even as the 2019 Lok Sabha election draws near, the path ahead for the BJP to retain its rule in New Delhi increasingly looks challenging, far from the buoyancy that it had ahead of the 2014 General elections, owing to the massive Narendra Modi wave that swept the country's political scene. What's worse, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, on whose shoulders lies the huge responsibility of steering his party to a win in the state in the big poll next year, has failed to deliver on multiple occasions now. How patient the BJP top brass would be, with these kinds of back-to-back failures, remains to be seen, as the defeats are a clear indicator of the growing clout of the Opposition in the state. What's notable is that Congress is playing second fiddle in most of these contests, allowing regional satraps to lead the charge. The result so far has been impressive for the Opposition, which is trying to regroup after the big failures in Lok Sabka election 2014 and Uttar Pradesh Assembly election in 2017. On Thursday, after nine rounds of counting in the Kairana Lok Sabha seat, Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal received 66.47 percent of the votes (46,909 votes) while BJP's Mriganka Singh got 31.13 percent (21,970 votes). RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan, who is leading Mriganka in the parliamentary constituency, looks confident of winning the seat if the trend continues in this manner. Mriganka also contested the Assembly elections in Kairana but lost heavily to Samajwadi Party's Nahid Hasan, who is the son of party's former MP Munawar Khan. On the other hand, Samajwadi Party is leading in the Noorpur Assembly seat as well. SP candidate Naeem Ul Hasan is currently ahead of BJP's Avani Singh in the Noorpur seat. The by election to Noorpur Assembly seat was necessitated by the death of sitting BJP MLA Lokendra Singh Chauhan in a road accident in February. In Kairana, the grand alliance against BJP is at play, with the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and SP all offering their support to the RLD. Hassan had won the seat in 2009 on a BSP ticket, against Mriganka, daughter of BJP winner in 2014 Hukum Singh whose death necessitated the bypoll. Kairana parliamentary constituency has five Assembly segments: Shamli, Thana Bhawan and Kairana in Shamli district, and Gangoh and Nakur in Saharanpur district. According to the Election Commission, there are 16.09 lakh voters in Kairana: 8.73 lakh male voters and 7.36 lakh female voters. Noorpur Assembly constituency has 3.06 lakh voters.  , where Samajwadi Party's Hasan represents the Assembly seat, all the remaining four Assembly seats falling under the Kairana Lok Sabha seat are with the BJP. Thana Bhawan is with Suresh Kumar, Shamli is with Tejendra Nirwal, Nakur is with Dharam Singh Saini and Gangoh is with Pradeep Kumar, all from the BJP. However, despite the advantage, the combined strength of Congress, SP and RLD proved to be too much for the BJP.  , the Opposition replicated the formula they used in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by elections early this year, where the ruling party suffered an unexpected defeat. The withdrawal of candidature of Lok Dal's Kanwar Hasan from the fray and his joining of the RLD has only added to the Opposition's confidence. Apart from them, the BJP had thrown in at least five state ministers into the 'fight for Kairana'. They included Dharam Singh Saini (Minister of State for Ayush), Suresh Rana (sugarcane development minister), Anupama Jaiswal (basic education minister) Surya Pratap Shahi (agriculture minister) and Laxmi Narayan (religious affairs, culture, minority welfare, waqf and Haj minister). Jaiswal is the minister in charge of Shamli district, while Shahi is the minister in charge of Saharanpur. ""Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary has been roped in since he hails from a farming background,"" a senior Uttar Pradesh BJP leader had said. BJP MPs Sanjiv Baliyan, Raghav Lakhan Pal, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar and Kanta Kardam also actively campaigned for Mriganka. The SP and Congress, however, had termed the line-up of Uttar Pradesh ministers as a sign of ""party jitters"". According to the locals, the major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers. RLD candidate Hasan had accused the BJP-led state government of resorting to divisive politics. ""Sugarcane growers in the region are feeling the maximum amount of pain, as no payments have been made to them by the state government,"" she had told  , rejecting the official claim that the dues from sugar mills were being cleared. The issue was also raised during an election meeting of state minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, who said that the dues accumulated from the time of the past governments had been paid out, and the rest would be settled soon. ""In Uttar Pradesh, 10,828.59 lakh quintals of sugarcane were purchased by sugar mills from farmers during the BJP government in 2017-18, as compared to 6443.41 lakh quintals under the Samajwadi Party government in 2015-16. Similarly, Rs 21,186.56 crore payments were made during the BJP government in the state in 2017-18, in comparison to Rs 11,841.34 crore made during the SP government in 2015-16,"" BJP spokesperson Chandramohan had said. Divergent views also emerged on the reported 2016 exodus of Hindu families from Kairana. ""The area is adjacent to Panipat district in Haryana. The labourers (both Hindus and Muslims) from the area go to the neighbouring state to work in the industries there. They go in the morning and return in the evening,"" Hasan had said while rejecting the claims of any such exodus. The RLD leader further said that the locked houses, even of Muslims who had gone to Panipat for work, were photographed and used as a ""propaganda"". ""In Kairana, both Hindus and Muslims live in peace,"" she had added. Mriganka, on the other hand, had said, ""The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped now. But hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment before the 2017 UP Assembly elections"". The present defeat would compound problems for the BJP as in March this year, SP had won both the Lok Sabha seats of Gorakhpur and Phulpur, which were vacated by Adityanath and Maurya.  its bitter rival Samajwadi Party, the BJP had to absorb a shock defeat in both the constituencies in what was seen as a major embarrassment to Adityanath in particular. Samajwadi Party's Nagendra Singh Patel had won the Phulpur seat beating BJP's Kashlendra Singh Patel while Pravin Nishad of the Samajwadi Party won over the BJP candidate Upendra Dutt Shukla in Gorakhpur, which Adityanath had won five consecutive times. There is little doubt that the upcoming Lok Sabha election is altogether a different ball game and if BJP wants to repeat its 2014 feat, it'll have no choice but to totally rejig its electoral strategy.",FP Staff
"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday launched and an attack on Congress president Rahul Gandhi with regards to his statements on China as he embarked upon a  . BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra held a press conference to show a montage of Rahul's recent statements comparing India and China and his stand on the Doka La issue. Patra alleged that during the Doka La standoff, Rahul went to meet the Chinese ambassador with family during midnight. He alleged that when the news came in media, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala at first denied it terming the reports as fake but the party had to accept it later. Calling the Congress chief ""Chinese Gandhi"", Patra claimed that Rahul did not take Indian authorities into confidence before meeting Chinese officials. Patra alleged that Rahul goes on foreign visits and represents himself as a ""Chinese spokesperson"" and even though he confessed in Germany on his latest visit that he had ""no knowledge about the Doka La issue"", he continues to speak on it in India and had even called it ""Dhoka La"". Patra further alleged that Rahul has a ""soft-corner"" for China and thus wants to get its perspective on everything including issues related to India and its economy. Citing Rahul's tweet on 31 December, 2017, Patra claimed that instead of keeping in mind India's perspective and focusing on the employment figures provided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Parliament, Rahul chose to compare India's job creation figures with China. He alleged that even during a meeting with tech entrepreneurs earlier in 2018, Rahul had proclaimed his ""love for China"" by telling the entrepreneurs to ""make sure that they do not annoy the Chinese by only accepting funding from American Venture Capitalist (VC) firms"". Talking on Rahul's visit to the Himalayan pilgrimage, Patra said that as Rahul flew to Nepal's Kathmandu from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, a Chinese envoy came to escort him. According to reports, Rahul is going to go to the shrine of Lord Shiva  . ""We would like to ask the Congress party that which politicians is Rahul Gandhi going to meet in China and what discussion will he have with them?"" Patra remarked. However, the Congress has hit back on BJP by clarifying that Rahul is on a ""personal visit"" to the pilgrimage. Senior Congress Ashok Gehlot slammed the BJP for ""playing politics"" even as Rahul, for his faith in Lord Shiva, is on a ""holy journey"".",FP Staff

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 31 May launched three Indian mobile payment apps in Singapore at a business event aimed at increasing the global outreach of the country's digital payment platforms. At the 'Business, Innovation and Community’ event, where ‘digital platform’ was the main theme, Modi launched India's BHIM, RuPay and SBI app. The RuPay digital payments system was linked with Singapore's 33-year-old Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS). RuPay users will be able to make payments at all NETS acceptance points across Singapore. Holders of Singapore NETS will be able to make online purchases on the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) e-commerce merchant website, using 2.8 million RuPay point-of-sale terminals in India. Industry observers said it would create multi-billion dollar worth of transactions as some five million Indians travel to and transit through Singapore, internationalising RuPay beginning with the first cross border usage. Also, a new app-based rupee remittance mode of the SBI's Singapore branch was launched at the event. Singapore branch of the SBI is the first to launch this new mode of remittance in collaboration with NPCI. ""This is a major step towards the internationalisation of India's digital payment platform,"" Prasad said. It will be most convenient for Indian blue-collar workers in Singapore to use the app for sending money home from their dormitories at work sites, he said. Remittance of up to Rs 1,00,000 will be made quick, easy and convenient with the help of Virtual Payment Address (VPA). This service will be available to all savings account holders of SBI Singapore. SBI has six branches in Singapore as well as Auto Teller Machines (ATMs).

"The Madras High Court on Thursday upheld Tamil Nadu speaker's decision to disqualify 18 All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) MLAs for “anti-party activities” in 2017. With this verdict, the high court has cleared the path for by-elections in the 18 constituencies previously held by the disqualified MLAs. In September 2017, Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker P Dhanapal disqualified 18 AIADMK MLAs under the 1986 Tamil Nadu Assembly Members Party Defection Law triggering a political crisis in the state after they announced their support for rebel AIADMK leader TTV Dhinakaran. Post their disqualification, the   the then governor C Vidyasagar Rao, expressing no confidence in Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, and asked for his removal. Alleging mala fide intention by the Speaker, the rebel MLAs had moved the Madras High Court to reinstate them. After hearing the matter, a bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar had delivered a split verdict on 14 June. While Banerjee  Sundar disagreed. In her 200-page order, the chief justice had upheld the Speaker's decision, saying, ""In my opinion, the view taken by the Speaker is a possible, if not plausible view, and I am unable to hold that the said decision is any way unreasonable, irrational or perverse."" Justice Sundar, in his 135-page order, had disagreed, insisting that Dhanapal's order ""deserved to be set aside on grounds of perversity, non-compliance with principles of natural justice, mala fides and violation of the constitutional mandate"". Following the split verdict, Justice S Vimala was appointed to hear the petitions afresh. However, the disqualified MLAs moved the SC raising apprehension of ""bias"" and sought to transfer the matter to the apex court. The SC had then named Justice Sathyanarayanan, while declining to accept a prayer of the disqualified MLAs to move the case to the SC. Sathyanarayanan had reserved his orders on 31 August, after 12 days of a meticulous hearing. The case was listed for judgment late on Wednesday night. The verdict is being watched closely in political circles in the state since it has the potential to decide the future course of Tamil Nadu politics. With the high court upholding the disqualification, by-elections will be held for the 18 constituencies. There will be another trust vote, but with the strength of the Tamil Nadu Assembly reducing to 215, the AIADMK has enough numbers in the bag to feel secure. The verdict also means that Palaniswami will also cement his position as the leader of AIADMK's and will be in a better position to bargain with the BJP in case alliance talks are held for the elections, reported  The disqualified MLAs include: S Thangatamilselvan (Andipatti), R Murugan (Harur), S Mariappan Kennedy (Manamadurai), K Kadirkamu (Periyakulam), Jayanthi Padmanabhan (Gudiyattam), P Palaniappan (Pappireddypatti), V Senthil Balaji (Aravakurichi), S Muthiah (Paramakudi), P Vetrivel (Perambur), NG Pathiban (Sholingur), M Kodandapani (Tiruporur), TA Elumalai (Poonamallee), M Rengasamy (Thanjavur), R Thangadurai (Nilakottai), R Balasubramani (Ambur), SG Subramanian (Sattur), R Sundaraj (Ottapidaram) and Uma Maheswari (Vilathikulam).

" The Supreme Court Monday asked the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to decide on the merits and maintainability of the issue raised by the Tamil Nadu government on Vedanta’s plea challenging the closure of its Sterlite plant at Tuticorin. The top court said the NGT should consider these issues after a three-member committee, constituted by the green panel to look into environmental compliance and other issues of Sterlite plant, submits its report. A bench of Justices R.F. Nariman and Indu Malhotra said it has already asked the NGT to consider the issues of merit and maintainability. “Since our order is not mentioned in the NGT’s order of August 20, we need to remind the tribunal that once the report of the committee comes, it will decide the issues of merit and maintainability,” the bench said. Senior advocate C.A. Sundaram, appearing for Vedanta, said he had no problem if the NGT decides both the issues as all relevant materials were with them. “You have not brought our earlier order to the notice of the tribunal. We say so, as it does not find mention in the order of tribunal. We are only on one point, that our order has to be obeyed,” the bench said. Sundaram said they also wanted that the top court’s order should be complied with. “We have brought it to the notice of tribunal,” but it has gone ahead and constituted the committee. “How can the court go ahead without deciding the maintainability,” the bench said and added that the Water Act provides that the matter should be heard by the tribunal. Senior advocate C.S. Vaidyanathan, appearing for Tamil Nadu, said the parties can go to High Court also. Sundaram said let there be no committee and the arguments on the issues of merit and maintainability should be held before the NGT. When the bench asked the parties about their objections to the committee, Vaidyanathan said he had an objection. The bench then said it will pass order and directed the NGT to decide the issues of merit and maintainability. On August 31, the green panel had appointed former Meghalaya high court Chief Justice Tarun Agrawal as the head of a three-member committee to decide on Vedanta’s plea challenging the closure of its Sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin. The apex court had on August 17, refused to entertain Tamil Nadu government’s plea against the NGT order allowing mining major Vedanta access to the administrative unit inside its closed Sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin and asked the NGT to “finally decide” the matter. It had said that the NGT would hear the matter on merits and also on the issue of maintainability raised by the state government. The tribunal had on August 9 allowed Vedanta to enter its administrative unit inside its Sterlite copper plant, observing that no environmental damage would be caused by allowing access to the administrative section. The state government had challenged the NGT’s order in the apex court. In its August 9 order, the NGT had said that the plant would remain closed and the company would not have access to its production unit and directed the district magistrate to ensure this. The Tamil Nadu government had on May 28 ordered the state pollution control board to seal and “permanently” close the mining group’s copper plant following violent protests over pollution concerns. Sterlite’s factory had made headlines in March 2013 when a gas leak led to the death of one person and injuries to several others, after which then chief minister J. Jayalalithaa had ordered its closure. The company had appealed to the NGT which had overturned the government’s order. The state had moved the Supreme Court against it, which had then ordered the company to pay Rs 100 crore as compensation for polluting the environment. After Sterlite announced its plans to expand Tuticorin plant, villagers around it started fresh protests that continued for over 100 days, culminating in the May 22 police firing on protestors that claimed 13 lives and left scores injured. Following these protests and police firing, the plant was closed on March 27.",PTI
" Amid discontent among some of the ruling coalition members in Karnataka, state BJP president BS Yeddyurappa on Friday claimed that several leaders from both Congress and JD(S) were ready to join his party. Addressing the BJP state executive meet, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly also termed the JD(S)-Congress partnership an ""unholy coalition"" and the budget scheduled to be presented by it on July 5 as a ""minority budget"". He asked his partymen to work towards ensuring the BJP wins 25 of the state's 28 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 national elections. ""Several Congress and JD(S) leaders are ready to join the BJP in the current political situation. I appeal to leaders to work towards strengthening the party by bringing in honest and capable people without thinking that new inductees would affect their own chances,"" he said. ""Those who are ready to come to the BJP, we have to go to them personally, to their houses and talk to them and bring them to the party fold and strengthen the party for Lok Sabha polls,"" he said. Earlier too, when there was widespread dissatisfaction in both Congress and JD(S) following the cabinet expansion, Yeddyurappa had claimed that several ""disgruntled"" leaders from the ruling coalition were eager to join his party. Yeddyurappa's recent Ahmedabad trip to meet party national president Amit Shah had fuelled speculations that several dissatisfied Congress MLAs were in touch with him and ready to switch over, which might again try its hand to form a government in the state. However, he himself had sought to end the speculation, saying he had gone to invite Shah for Friday's state unit executive meeting. Yeddyurappa had resigned as chief minister without facing a vote of confidence in the assembly last month as the BJP lacked the numbers for a majority. The BJP on Friday held its first state executive meeting after the assembly elections in the state in May this year. It was attended by party General Secretary Muralidhar Rao, Union ministers Ananth Kumar, Ramesh Jigajinagi, and former chief minister Jagadish Shettar, among others. Explaining the circumstances under which he had to resign as chief minister, that led to the formation of Congress-JD(S) coalition government, Yeddyurappa said although legislators from different political parties were ready to join BJP, ""because of paucity of time, we had to face the setback"". He accused Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy of making ""false"" promises in the JD(S) manifesto. Listing out pre-poll promises of the JD(S), including the farm loan waiver among others, he called on BJP leaders and workers to go to people with Congress and JD(S) manifestos and inform them that both parties have not walked the talk. Terming the the budget to be presented on 5 July as ""budget of 37 MLAs"" and ""minority budget"", Yeddyurappa pointed out that the Congress Legislature Party Leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah has opposed the budget. ""There is confusion between Congress and JD(S), so the budget they will present will not have any sanctity,"" he claimed. He said, ""This is the budget with the support of just 37 JD(S) MLAs."" ""There is no Congress support to it... there is no sanctity to it. Let's wait and watch what stand the Congress takes in the assembly,"" he added. Discordant voices have emerged from the Congress and the JD(S) on a host of issues, including presentation of the budget, as Siddaramaiah, who held finance portfolio in the previous government, had recently said there was no need for a fresh budget and insisted that a supplementary budget would suffice. Speaking about differences between the Congress and JD(S), Yeddyurappa told his partymen that the two parties were fighting among themselves and their government was likely to fall. ""...(Hence) let us not take sides. There are no signs of this unholy coalition government continuing. So as a responsible opposition both inside and outside the Assembly, we will have to continue our fight for the cause of people,"" he said. He also termed as ""irresponsible"" Kumaraswamy's statement that he was not at the mercy of people of Karnataka, but of the Congress party. Noting that BJP and its workers had worked with confidence of winning 130-135 seats in the 12 May Assembly elections, Yeddyurappa said, ""Even when there was pro-BJP wave across the state, because of our own mistakes, we could not win 130-135 seats. This is a painful matter.""",Press Trust of India

"WhatsApp has informed the government that it is building a local team, including India head, as part of steps to check fake news circulation but has not met the key demand of identifying message originators, according to official sources. The popular messaging app is under fire over abuse of its platform for circulation of fake news that have incited mob fury. The IT Ministry official said that WhatsApp has responded to the government’s last notice, outlining initiatives being taken to curb fake news circulation including education and advocacy efforts. It is also building an India-based team, the official said but noted that the measures do not meet the government's expectations on 'traceability' and attribution of such messages. WhatsApp, on its part, has maintained that message attributions would ""undermine the private nature"" of the platform, and leave it vulnerable potentially to ""serious misuse"", a company official said. ""People rely on WhatsApp for all kinds of sensitive conversations, including with their doctors, banks and families. The police also use WhatsApp to discuss investigations and report crimes,” the spokesperson said. “Attributing messages on WhatsApp would undermine the private nature of WhatsApp and create the potential for serious misuse. Our focus is on improving WhatsApp and working closely with others in society to help keep people safe,"" the spokesperson added. WhatsApp said it believes the challenge of mob violence requires government, civil society, and technology companies to work together. ""It's why we've already made significant product changes to help slow the spread of misinformation and are working to educate people on how to spot fake news,"" WhatsApp said. Expressing its ‘deep commitment’ to helping people across India communicate in a safe, secure, and reliable manner, WhatsApp noted that its Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema had recently travelled to India and met with representatives of IT Ministry. Meanwhile, the Ministry official who did not wish to be named said WhatsApp, in its response, has informed the government that it has registered a legal entity in India. But the platform has not committed itself on 'traceability' and attribution of messages, the official said, adding that this had been one of the key demands of the government. Last month, the government had expressed dissatisfaction over measures previously listed by WhatsApp for checking fake news that have, in several cases, triggered mob violence. The IT ministry, in its missive, had said that the platform cannot escape its responsibility for such rampant abuse and needed to find originators of provocative messages. The government, in its second notice to the Facebook-owned messaging service, had warned that in the absence of adequate checks, it will treat the messaging platform as ‘abettor' of rumour propagation and legal consequences will follow. Rumours on WhatsApp have sparked off a spate of incidents involving mob violence. The incidents have raised eyebrows, and the Supreme Court, last month, asked Parliament to consider enacting a new law to effectively deal with incidents of mob lynching, saying ""horrendous acts of mobocracy"" cannot be allowed to become a new norm. Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has also informed the Rajya Sabha that he will hold a discussion with stakeholders, including political parties, to evolve a policy to deal with the misuse of social media. Over the last few weeks, WhatsApp has introduced a new feature to let its users identify the forwarded messages, restricted number of forwards at a time, and brought out full-page ads giving ""easy tips"" to spot fake news. But the IT ministry has directed WhatsApp to bring more effective solutions to the table, to ensure greater ""accountability and facilitate enforcement of the law"" beyond the existing efforts towards labelling forwards and identifying fake news.

"The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress in Rajasthan have fielded 11 turncoats for the 7 December Assembly polls, hoping that the ""parachute"" candidates will shine for them in the elections. Voices of dissent are being heard from both parties and sidelined party leaders are quick to cross over to get a chance to contest. The ruling BJP alone has fielded seven defectors, including six from the Congress and one from the BSP. BJP nominees Mahesh Pratap Singh from Nathdawara, Ram Kishor Saini from Bandikui, Mamta Sharma from Pipalda, Kalpna Singh from Ladpura, Rajendra Bhamu from Jhunjhunu and Ashok Sharma from Rajkhera are the leaders who crossed over to the saffron brigade from the Congress. Another defector from the BSP, Abhinesh Mehrishi, replaced sitting BJP minister Rajkumar Rinwa from Ratangarh seat. Not to be left behind, the Congress has given tickets to at least four turncoats to test electoral waters. Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who had in August stated that he will make sure that party workers have their say and no parachute candidate gets nominated in the next assembly elections in Rajasthan, seems to have swallowed his own words while finalising the ticket list for bright prospects of the party in the state. Rajasthan state Congress President Sachin Pilot said the decision was taken by the party high command on case-to-case basis. Turncoats, who managed to get Congress tickets just after a few hours or days after leaving the BJP, include Harish Meena, Habib-ir-Rehman, Manvendra Singh and Zamindara Party legislator Sona Devi Bawri. MP from Dausa, Harish Meena, who had quit the party a day ago, has been fielded from Deoli-Uniara on a Congress ticket.

" As several parts of Maharashtra continued to reel under caste violence, Congress on Wednesday accused the RSS and certain Hindutva outfits of triggering it and demanded a probe by a Supreme Court judge into the clashes. Forcefully raising the issue in Lok Sabha during the Zero Hour, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge also trained his guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wondering why he was maintaining a studied silence on the issue. ""The RSS and certain hardcore Hindutva outfits are behind the violence. They are trying to drive a wedge between the Marathas and Dalits in Maharashtra,"" Kharge alleged.

He always maintained silence on issues relating to Dalits. He has become a 'Mouni Baba'on Dalit issues,"" he said.

"As India’s #metoo movement takes off, with women publicly outing cases of sexual harassment and assault, one of the biggest names   is Union minister MJ Akbar. Akbar has had a long, successful career in journalism and is widely seen as one of India’s most pioneering editors. He launched India’s first weekly magazine on politics,  , in 1976 and two daily newspapers, the   and the  , in 1989 and 1994. Currently, Akbar is Minister of State for External Affairs in the Modi government. Akbar was first named in a   by senior journalist Priya Ramani on Monday, who identified Akbar as the unnamed editor whose inappropriate behaviour she had written about in an article in October 2017. Since then, seven more women have come forward to accuse Akbar of sexual harassment. In spite of the gravity and breadth of the charges and the fact that he is a Union minister, however, the Indian press has not given the Akbar story the space it deserves.  All this might change, however, with more serious allegations emerging in a detailed story of “sexual assault and harassment” that was   on Wednesday, where a journalist described her harrowing ordeal and how her “last six months as a journalist at  , the newspaper he edited, were pure hell with repeated physical advances.” The  , India’s largest English language newspaper, did not carry the allegations against Akbar on its front page on Wednesday. It did run with  Akbar in a   which had actor Alok Nath in its headline but only reported on the fact that the Union government had not responded to the allegations – without any details on the allegations themselves.

"Sunrisers Hyderabad defeated Mumbai Indians by 31 runs in a low-scoring IPL match on Tuesday, 24 April, forcing the defending champions into their fifth loss in six games in the 2018 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Mumbai ended Hyderabad’s innings at 118 runs in 18.4 overs, setting a seemingly low target. But hosts Mumbai Indians were sent packing, all out for 87 in 18.5 overs at Wankhede Stadium. Hyderabad ended their two-match losing run and are third in the points table with eight points from six matches. Earlier in the first innings, put in to bat, the Sunrisers failed to recover from the dreadful start, of being reduced to 46/4 inside the powerplay, with Shikhar Dhawan (5), Wriddhiman Saha (0), Manish Pandey (16) and Shakib Al Hasan (2) all back in the hut inside the first six overs. Skipper Kane Williamson waged a lone battle with a fighting 21-ball 29, laced with five hits to the fence before veteran Baroda batsman Yusuf Pathan (29 off 33 balls; 4x2, 6x1) took on the mantle, despite losing his partners at regular intervals. Dhawan, who returned to the playing XI after missing the previous game against Chennai Super Kings (CSK), looked uncomfortable after being hit on his thigh and was bowled by Mitchell McClenaghan the very next ball. One ball later, Saha perished for nought after being caught behind by Ishan Kishan off McClenaghan. With the team struggling at 20/2, Manish joined Williamson for a brief 24-run third wicket stand before Hardik ended Manish's stay with a wide delivery, comfortably caught by skipper Rohit Sharma at cover. Mumbai could not have asked for a better start, with Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib falling prey to confusion, and Suryakumar Yadav's direct throw at the stumps was enough to reduce the visitors to 46/4. Pathan then joined Williamson, who looked fluent with his strokes but lost concentration on the very first ball after the strategic time-out to be caught behind by Kishan off Hardik Pandya. With Williamson back in the dug-out, Mohammed Nabi (14) joined Pathan for a brief 23-run sixth-wicket stand before leg-spinner Mayank Markande's googly clipped the top of middle and leg of the Afghanistan all-rounder. Sunrisers fell prey to yet another confusion in the middle, this time losing the wicket of tail ender Siddharth Kaul (2), comfortably run out by Hardik. With Sandeep Sharma (0 not out) in company, Pathan's ploy of playing the waiting game only resulted in a monstrous six off Mustafizur Rahman, but the Bangladeshi came back in style to pack back the right-hander the next ball, and restrict Sunrisers for a meagre 118. During the chase, Mumbai too began on a horrendous note. Ervin Lewis (5), Ishan Kishan (0) and Rohit Sharma (2) fell soon as the hosts were reduced to 21/3 in 5.2 overs. Suryakumar and Krunal Pandya then shared a handy 40-run partnership to keep Mumbai on track. Leg-spinner Rashid Khan got a LBW decision against Krunal to break the partnership, with Mumbai needing 58 from 8.2 overs. Rashid struck again to dismiss Kieron Pollard (9) in the first delivery of the 14th over to increase the visitors's hopes - which grew further when Suryakumar was caught by Rashid off Thampi in the following over. At this juncture, Mumbai were 77/6, still needing 42 off 5.1 overs. In the following over, medium pacer Siddharth Kaul got two LBW decisions against Mitchell McClenaghan (0) and Mayank Markande (1) as Mumbai tottered at 80/8 at the end of 17 overs. Amidst all this, India all-rounder Hardik Pandya had scored just three runs off 16 deliveries and was Mumbai's sole hope. But Kaul made him his third wicket when he was caught by Thampi at third man in the fourth delivery of the 18th over. Thamp then had Mustafizur Rahman (1) caught by Deepak Hooda at midwicket to complete Mumbai's annihilation. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

" The Madras high court on Friday made it clear that the Aadhaar card and its photocopy are compulsory during counselling to medical admissions in Tamil Nadu. Justice N. Kirubakaran was passing interim orders on petitions alleging that students from outside Tamil Nadu were admitted to medical courses without any scrutiny of the genuineness of their nativity. The judge directed authorities of medical education in Tamil Nadu to insist on production of Aadhaar cards. The petitioners alleged that many students from other states have been allotted MBBS seats in Tamil Nadu based on nativity certificates obtained fraudulently, while adversely affecting the scope of students from Tamil Nadu to get admitted to the courses. Earlier, a committee of advocates and government officials informed the court that a random verification of nativity certificates presented by 296 students admitted to MBBS (2017-18) courses in Tamil Nadu through National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) under CBSE category were found to be issued without any inquiry or scrutiny. G Karthikeyan, assistant solicitor general (ASG), sought time to get the details of the persons who applied in Tamil Nadu as well as in other states. After hearing the ASG and counsel for petitioners, the judge said, “It is stated that in all other states Aadhaar number of the student has to be provided in the application itself.” This has been confirmed by various counsel saying that other states have made it compulsory to give Aadhaar number of the respective candidates, the judge said. To confirm that the genuine state candidates are benefited under the state quota, it is appropriate to make the production of Aadhaar card and a photocopy of it compulsory at the time of counselling, he said. By this method, students from other states could be prevented from getting the benefit under the state quota, the judge said. Therefore, the authorities are directed to inform the candidates who have applied for medical admission to produce their Aadhaar card and its photocopy at the time of admission, he said. The necessity as per this order about bringing the Aadhaar card should be published by authorities on websites and by way of news reports within two days so that candidates get to know about the production of Aadhaar cards in advance, the judge said.

""If I have become chief minister today, it's because of all of you. It's not because of one community alone. I will bring in all the programmes we have promised. I want to assure people that there is no change in my position or politics. But we must remember that it's a coalition government and not me alone. Whatever decisions I take will be taken in consultation with the alliance partners. But I will balance things such a way that it's in the best interests of people of Karnataka. I invite all citizens to come forward and contact us directly with whatever grievances you have. I am always with you all,"" he said, while addressing the media after visiting the Chamundeshwari temple. Traffic congestion is expected on all roads near the Vidhan Soudha on Wednesday between 2.30 pm and 5.30 pm. Traffic jams can be expected at Cubbon Park, Kanakapura Road and Mysore Road as supporters from different parts of Karnataka are expected to attend HD Kumaraswamy's swearing-in ceremony. According to  , arrangements have been made for placing one lakh chairs in front of the Vidhan Soudha. The road between legislative assembly building and the Karnataka High Court will be cordoned off and chairs will be placed there. There is also a separate enclosure with 3,000 seats for VIPs. Unfazed by the fall of its three-day government last week in Karnataka, a defiant BJP's state unit will protest across the state on Wednesday against the formation of the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition government, a party official said on Tuesday. ""As the Congress-JD(S) alliance hijacked the people's mandate and formed an unholy alliance to form a coalition government on Wednesday, we are observing the occasion as the 'Anti-People's Mandate Day' across the state,"" said BJP's spokesman S Shantaram in a statement in Bengaluru. Several national leaders including United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati are expected to attend JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy's swearing-in ceremony in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Chief ministers of non-BJP states and heads of regional parties such as N Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh), Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal), Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi), Pinarayi Vijayan (Kerala), Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and Kollywood superstar Kamal Haasan of Makkal Needhi Maiam party in Tamil Nadu will also be in attendance. The 34-member Cabinet will have 22 ministers from the Congress and 12 from JD(S), Congress leader KC Venugopal said on Tuesday, adding they would be sworn in after the floor test slated for Thursday. A JD(S)-Congress coalition government headed by HD Kumaraswamy will be sworn-in on Wednesday in Karnataka at a ceremony attended by a galaxy of Opposition leaders and chief ministers, a development that could plant a seed for a broad-based anti-BJP platform before the Lok Sabha polls next year. Karnataka Congress president G Parameshwara will be sworn-in as the deputy chief minister, AICC general secretary in-charge of the state KC Venugopal said. Congress's Ramesh Kumar, a former minister, will be the next Speaker, while the Deputy Speaker's post will go to the JD(S), Venugopal told  . The Congress would have 22 ministers and JD(S) 12, he said, adding they would be sworn in after the floor test slated for Thursday. Kumaraswamy will be the second chief minister to take oath in Karnataka within a week, after BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa stepped down without facing the floor test on 19 May in the face of imminent defeat. The JD(S)'s chief minister-designate said portfolio distribution will be discussed on Friday and a coordination committee will be formed to facilitate smooth functioning of the coalition. Kumaraswamy, the third son of JD(S) supremo and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda, will be administered the oath of office and secrecy by Governor Vajubhai Vala at 4.30 pm in front of Vidhana Soudha, seat of the government in Bengaluru. A huge stage has been erected in front of the majestic stone building for the ceremony where a host of national and regional leaders are expected to be present to send a message across to the BJP over the shape of things to come in 2019. Government officials and sources in the JD(S) said Congress president Rahul Gandhi, his mother and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Chandrababu Naidu, Arvind Kejriwal and Pinarayi Vijayan, her counterparts in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Kerala, are among those likely to be present. So would be CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, one of the most vocal votaries of an anti-BJP alliance, Tejashwi Yadav, the Leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah. BSP chief Mayawati and SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, who have formed an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, would also attend the ceremony. DMK leader MK Stalin, who was also expected to be present in order to show the burgeoning Opposition consolidation against the BJP, has cancelled his Bengaluru visit and would instead head for Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu where nine people were killed in police firing on Tuesday. It will be Kumaraswamy's second term in office. He had earlier headed the JD(S)-BJP coalition government for 20 months between February 2006 and October 2007. Managing the contradictions in the coalition may not be a smooth sailing for the 58-year-old leader after the JD(S) and Congress fought a bitter electoral battle in the state, particularly the old Mysuru region. Kumaraswamy himself conceded on Tuesday that running the coalition government for the next five years will be a ""big challenge"" for him. The first task for him would be a smooth expansion of his Council of Ministers, as the Congress would want to have a big share in the ministerial pie as it has more than double the number of MLAs JD(S) has. The Congress has 78 lawmakers in the Lower House against 37 of the JD(S). A section of Lingayat MLAs of the Congress wanted a person from their community to be the deputy chief minister as Kumaraswamy belongs to another politically influential caste Vokkaliga. However, Rahul Gandhi approved the name of Dalit leader G Parameshwara for the post, Venugopal said. DK Shivakumar, another Vokkaliga leader of the Congress, who emerged a key figure in keeping the party MLAs together before the trust vote, was also a contender for the deputy chief minister's chair but the party high command opted for Parameshwara. The BJP, which is the single largest party with 104 MLAs in the 224-member Assembly whose effective strength is 221, would not allow Kumaraswamy to have a smooth running. The BJP has dubbed the Congress-JD(S) alliance as ""unholy"", and claimed the government will not complete its full term. The saffron party has decided to boycott the oath-taking ceremony, and will observe ""anti-popular mandate day"" tomorrow to protest the formation of the coalition government. Senior BJP leaders would hold a protest in front of the Mahatma Gandhi's statue here, while its workers in black attire will hold demonstrations in districts, state BJP general secretary CT Ravi told reporters.",FP Staff

" The Supreme Court Thursday said there cannot be a blanket ban on media reporting in the Muzaffarpur shelter home sexual abuse case where several women were allegedly raped and sexually abused over time. A bench of Justices Madan B. Lokur and Deepak Gupta vacated the August 23 order of the Patna high court which had imposed a ban on media reporting about the investigations in the case. The apex court, however, asked both the print and electronic media not to sensationalise incidents of sexual abuse and violence. When the apex court on September 18 was hearing the matter, it had made reference of the recent Rewari gang rape case and asked as to why no action has been taken against media houses for flouting the law as “everything has been said” about the 19-year-old victim. The top court had also stayed a Patna High Court order to set up a fresh CBI team to probe the case, saying that such a move would not only be detrimental to the ongoing investigation but also to the victims. The Patna High Court, which has been monitoring the probe, had on August 23 expressed displeasure over the leak of details of the investigation and asked the media to refrain from publishing it as it could be detrimental to the probe. A plea was filed against this on September 5 in the apex court seeking a stay on the high court order restraining the media from reporting the investigation. In the plea filed before the apex court, the petitioner, a journalist, has claimed that there was no material before the high court to come to a conclusion that media reporting may hamper the ongoing investigation in the case. The apex court, while staying the high court’s order directing the CBI’s special director to put in place a fresh team to probe the case, had said that there was no reason now to change the existing investigating team which was set up the CBI Director. The high court had on August 29 ordered that a fresh team of investigators be constituted by the CBI’s special director in the case in which incidents of alleged rape and sexual assault of women inmates over a period of time had come to light in an NGO-run shelter home at Muzaffarpur in Bihar. Over 30 girls were allegedly raped at the shelter home run by one Brajesh Thakur, the chief of a state-funded NGO. The alleged sexual exploitation of the girls was first highlighted in an audit report submitted by TISS to the state’s social welfare department. An FIR was lodged against 11 people, including Thakur, on May 31. The probe was later taken over by the CBI. The incidents of alleged rape and sexual assault of the women inmates had come to light after a social audit was conducted by the Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). In all, the sexual abuse of 34 of the 42 inmates was confirmed in their medical examination. The TISS audit report had said that many girls at the shelter home had complained of sexual abuse. A special investigation team was formed to probe the complaints. The NGO running the shelter home in Muzaffarpur was blacklisted and the girls were shifted to shelter homes in Patna and Madhubani.

To build Siddaramaiah's case, Kharge recalled even Prime Minister Narendra Modi contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from two seats – Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Vadodara in Gujarat. He termed the reported fears about Siddaramaiah losing from Chamundeshwari seat in Mysuru as BJP's ""false propaganda."" The Karnataka chief minister is likely to file his nomination from Badami in north Karnataka on Tuesday. ""He can contest (from two constituencies). What is wrong in that? This is the high command's decision. People in Badami wanted him to contest from there also,"" Kharge told reporters. ""Didn't Modi contest from two constituencies? Did any question arise then,"" the Congress floor leader in Lok Sabha asked. Siddaramaiah has filed his nomination papers from Chamundeshwari. He has said he was under pressure from party leaders in Bagalkote and Vijayapura districts to contest from Badami, but he would leave the final decision to the Congress ""high command"". Responding to a question if Siddaramaiah was contesting from Badami because of the fear of losing in Chamundeshwari, Kharge said: ""It is a propaganda of BJP. They are experts. False propaganda is their job."" He said ""circumstances"" have forced the Karnataka chief minister to contest from two constituencies. Badami has a strong presence of Kuruba community, to which Siddaramaiah belongs. The constituency is seen as a safer option for him as reports have suggested the battle on Chamundeshwari seat will not be easy for the chief minister. Siddaramaiah has won five times and defeated twice in Chamundeshwari. He has represented the Varuna constituency in Mysuru since 2008. It's now been allotted to his son Yatindra. Asked whether Siddaramaiah's candidature from Badami was an after-thought, as another candidate's name was announced in the first list, Kharge said changes happen in all parties. In the second and final list announced by Congress on Sunday, Siddaramaiah replaced Devraj Patil from Badami constituency. Patil's name was there in the first list announced on 15 April. But the issuance of the 'B-form' to him was put on hold. Siddaramaiah's reported wish to contest from two seats, was said to have met with stiff opposition from Kharge and another leader Veerappa Moily, after which the party decided to field Patil. Kharge and Moily reportedly opposed two constituencies for Siddaramaiah stating it will consolidate Vokkaliga votes in favour of JD(S) in Mysuru region, and it will also send a wrong message about the chief minister lacking confidence. Asked whether Siddaramaiah will be the chief minister again if Congress comes to power in Karnataka, Kharge said: ""There is no such question. This is a hypothetical question. High command will decide."" On the promulgation of an ordinance for stringent punishment to child rapists, Kharge said Congress welcomes all measures to protect women, children and Dalits, but he questioned why the central government was not implementing properly the existing laws. ""As you did not implement the existing laws like the Nirbhaya law properly, there is a 500 percent increase in crimes against women and children. This is an ineffective government,"" he alleged.",PTI
"By 10 am on 15 May, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had emerged as the single-largest party in Karnataka. Celebrations broke out at the party headquarters. Spokespersons in news studios accused TV anchors of airing biased exit polls. However, by 2 pm, all had fallen silent. As the BJP’s lead slipped from 112 to hover around 104, the incumbent Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Congress’ state-in-charge Gulab Nabi Azad announced they were open to an alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)), offered the CM’s post to the party which has been ranked third in the contest, and hoped they would accompany them to Governor Vajubhai Vala’s residence. The JD(S) promptly agreed. Within minutes, breaking news tickers declared BS Yeddyurappa was on his way to the governor’s residence as well. What we have in Karnataka currently, is a stalemate. The governor has said that he will not be entertaining any proposals till the time the Election Commission declares the final results. So, what will be the next step for Vajubhai Vala, a former Gujarat BJP leader, who had, in 2002, vacated his Rajkot seat for Narendra Modi and had also served in his cabinet as a Finance Minister? Will he call upon the single-largest party to form the government as per convention or allow two political contenders who’ve agreed on a post-poll alliance to come to rule? If the Congress-JD(S) alliance keeps the BJP from making it to the majority mark, what are the options for the Karnataka governor? If Vala goes by constitutional tradition, he should call upon the single-largest party, in this case the BJP, to form the government. But the norm was not followed in the Manipur and Goa elections. In Goa, the governor had not contacted the Congress, which had emerged the single largest party and had allowed the BJP to form the government on a first-come-first serve basis. Similarly, in Manipur, although the Congress had emerged as the single-largest party, it had fallen short of majority while the BJP had garnered support from other MLAs in the state and the governor had invited the latter to form the government. The power and role of a governor had come under the scanner after the Goa and Manipur elections, where the Congress was caught napping while the BJP managed to get the support of the governor to form the government. Now that the tables have turned, it will be interesting to see how the governor responds to this political stalemate. There are other precedents as well: The governor can also call for a re-election if no like-minded parties are able to come together and form government. This is least likely in the current situation. The Sarkaria Commission set up by the central government in 1983 to examine and suggest changes within the framework of the Constitution of India, came out with a report in 1988, outlining the constitutional convention of inviting the single-largest party if there is a fractured mandate. The guidelines were affirmed by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in 2005. According to the recommendations of the commission, this is the order of preference the governor should follow while selecting a CM: The Government of India had constituted a commission to analyse the Centre-State Relations under the chairmanship of Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi, former Chief Justice of India on 27 April 2007. According to the recommendations of the commission, which were submitted in a seven-volume report on 30 March 2010, there should be clear guidelines for the appointment of chief ministers, so that there is regulation on the discretionary power of the governor. According to the recommendations, the following order of precedence ought to be followed by the governor in case of a hung House: In the Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix vs Deputy Speaker case in 2016, a five-judge bench, recommended to follow the Punchhi and Sarkaria Commissions regarding the role of the governor and said the governor was bound by the advice of the council of ministers. Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap, on 15 May, reiterated that, “It is up to the understanding of the governor whom he calls to form the government. It is up to him if he wants to call the single-largest party or a coalition government”. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint

" Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday slammed Arvind Kejriwal for alleging that the national capital was facing an ""alarming level"" of coal shortage, saying the Delhi chief minister was trying to hide his own ""failures"" by making such ""baseless"" claims. Kejriwal had on Tuesday written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to direct the railways to provide rakes for transporting coal to power plants in Delhi-NCR, which is facing ""alarming level"" of coal shortage. In his letter to Modi, the Delhi chief minister said that with rising temperatures and increasing power demand in Delhi, coal stock position is ""very alarming"" and needs immediate attention and intervention. Responding to Kejriwal's claims, Goyal said that states need to plan their coal requirements better, make timely payments to ensure that there is no shortage. ""He is trying to hide his own failures. As the coal or railway minister, he has not written any letter to me, neither has he come to meet me in the past four years regarding the issue. I used to look after power, he has never come to see me even then. ""All of last year, Delhi's power requirement was very low and now suddenly when the demand for power has gone up, they are requisitioning for more coal. In fact, we have doubled the number of rakes to Dadri when their requirements rose. That's not a small achievement,"" Goyal told reporters in New Delhi. He said that in Dadri, the demand for coal was low last year and it was running on three rakes per day all year. However, as this year the power demand went up, the demand for rakes more than doubled from 23 to 28 May, Goyal said, adding that around 39 rakes of coal were sent to the plant. Each rake is made up of 58 wagons and has a capacity of carrying 3,750 tonnes of coal, officials said. ""Both for coal mining and railway, it's not a switch on, switch off that overnight you say we need more rakes and the system can gear up to supply rakes overnight."" ""Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's claims of inadequate coal supply in Delhi are false and baseless.

" Senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan on Wednesday accused the BJP-led Maharashtra government of reducing the height of the proposed statue of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, to be constructed in the Arabian sea, from 160 metres to 126 metres. The state government has been maintaining that the height of the statue would be 210 metres and that it would be the tallest statue in the world. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had performed the ' ' for the Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial project off the Mumbai coast, in December 2016.

""The government claims that it has increased the height of the statue from 192 metres to 210 metres and that it would be the tallest statue in the world.

He said Union Environment Ministry on 23 February, 2015, approved the height of the statue at 160 metres and that of the pedestal at 32 metres, which collectively comes at 192 metres. ""However, the government amended the project plan on 23 December, 2016, and brought down the height of the statue to 126 metres while increasing the height of the pedestal to 84 metres. This means the government has reduced the height of the proposed bronze statue by 34 metres,"" said Chavan. The Congress leader asked the government to explain why the project plan was altered even after the environment ministry had given its final nod. ""Is it true that the clearance for the revised plan has not been received yet? Did the government reduce the height of the bronze statue as a cost-cutting measure because the financial condition of the state is not good? he asked. Chavan wondered how could Shivaji's statue would be the tallest in the world at a time when the BJP is claiming that the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, coming up in Gujarat, will be the tallest one. ""If Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity in Gujarat is 157 metres tall then how could Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's statue would be the tallest one?"" Chavan asked.

He also said that unlike BJP, Congress party has taken banks to every village. Mentioning the Rafale deal, Rahul said, ""Rafale deal was taken away from a public sector enterprise in Bengaluru and given to Modi's friend. This stole the jobs from Bengaluru youth. This is called corruption."" Reiterating his scathing attack on BJP president Amit Shah, he went on to say that today BJP's president is accused of murder and the whole country knows this. These things are expected from a party like BJP, whereas the people hold the Congress party at a high standard.

Noting that five major banks originated in Udupi district, Rahul said the Congress party's idea behind that was to take banks to the people, and blamed the Modi government for mounting Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in public sector banks. ""We took banks to villages. But if you see today, there are NPAs worth lakhs of crore of rupees of rich people. ""About 10-15 rich persons of India have taken away your Rs 8 lakh crore.

"Karnataka, one of the three states where the Congress is still in power, votes on Saturday, 12 May, with the party trying to retain power in the face of a stiff challenge from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in power in 20 states, either by itself or along with allies. The Janata Dal (Secular), the third corner of this three-cornered fight, will be hoping to get enough seats to do what it has done best in the past — punch above its weight. A forecast of unseasonal rains accompanied by thunder and lightning, especially in southern and coastal parts of the state, is a worry for all parties. If the forecast comes true, its impact on the turnout — and, therefore, the outcome — will preoccupy all the contenders. Karnataka has 50.6 million eligible voters.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an interview to  spoke on a range of issues, including the recent Supreme Court judges' rebellion, GST, demonetisation and the Congress. In his first comments on the judicial crisis, Modi on Sunday said the government and political parties must stay out of it while expressing confidence that the judiciary will sit together to find a solution to its problems. He also said the Indian judiciary has a bright history and is full of very capable people. ""Our country's judiciary has a very bright past, they are very capable people. They will sit together and find a solution to their problems. I have faith in our justice system, they will definitely figure out a solution,"" he said. Six months into the rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and after dozens of changes, Modi said he is open to more changes in the GST to plug loopholes and make it a more efficient tax. He also attacked those opposing the GST, saying they were ""insulting"" Parliament. He compared the new law with that for income tax, asking how many changes and improvements have been made in the income tax law since its inception in 1961. ""The GST too is a new system. I have been saying this since the day one that people will take some time to adjust to the new system,"" he said. ""We will have to improve wherever there are loopholes."" Modi also indicated that the upcoming Budget will not be a populist one and it's a myth that the common man expects ""freebies and sops"" from the government. He also pledged that his government will stay on the course of the reforms agenda that has pulled out India from being among the 'fragile five' economies of the world to being a 'bright spot'.

Maintaining that the Congress has been the ""main pillar"" of politics in the country that spread its culture to all political parties, he said that his call for ""Congress mukt"" or 'Congress-free India' was ""symbolic"" and he wants even the Congress to be free of the ""Congress culture"", according to the transcript provided by the channel. When asked about the triple talaq bill that was not passed in the Rajya Sabha and whether he was personally affected by it, Modi said the 'nation is bigger than the party' for him. ""When people are insulting GST, I can understand that it's their hunger for power and politics that makes them do that, but when a poor woman is at stake, it is difficult to see their point,"" said Modi. On being asked why there was no consensus on Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections being held simultaneously, Modi said that before 1967, the general elections and the state elections were held together and he is not the first one to suggest that they be held together. He went onto say that proper political dialogue becomes difficult when elections keep happening continuously. On the issue of India's foreign policy, Modi said it is based on the context of India. Modi also rejected the notion that India was putting ""so much hard work"" to isolate Pakistan, asserting that his efforts were aimed at uniting the world powers to defeat terrorism as his country has been suffering from the scourge since decades. He said the suggestion that the country's foreign policy was based on Pakistan was wrong but stressed that the world was uniting against those sympathetic towards terrorists, an apparent reference to the neighbouring country. Modi also praised US President Donald Trump for raising his voice against terror with ""a lot of assertion"". With regards to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu supporting his ""hard power"" towards terrorism, Modi said, ""I'm thankful to Netanyahu for praising India but when it comes to terrorism, there is nothing called hard power or soft power, it is about humanity. Humanitarian values need to unite to combat terrorism and since this is about saving humanity, there cannot be a bigger soft power than this.""",FP Staff
"The Bombay High Court refused to grant relief to controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik, who is facing charges of inciting communal disharmony and committing unlawful activities, observing that he did not show any interest or desire to help the probe agencies, on Wednesday, 20 June. A division bench of Justices RM Savant and Revati Mohite Dere was hearing a petition filed by Naik seeking a direction to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to submit reports on the probe carried out by them against Naik. In the petition, Naik also sought direction to the Ministry of External Affairs to cancel the revocation of his passport. The court said it cannot pass any order pertaining to revocation of passport and asked Naik to file a separate petition for the same. The offences registered against Naik are under Section 153 (a) of IPC for promoting enmity among different religions and under Sections 10, 13 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for being a member of an unlawful association, abetting an unlawful activity and criminal conspiracy. ""These are serious offences in which a person faces maximum punishment up to life imprisonment. The petitioner has been declared a proclaimed offender and extradition proceedings have been initiated with the authorities in Malaysia. Under such circumstances, this court cannot grant any relief to the petitioner,"" Justice Savant said. The court added that Naik should have ideally come back to India and presented himself before the investigating agencies. ""Such long distance thing will not work. In the absentia of the petitioner, how can we entertain such pleas,"" it said. Naik's NGO – Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) – has also been declared unlawful since 2016 and is being probed by the ED over allegations of money laundering to the tune of more than Rs 18 crore.

"Vijay Thakur, the man accused of killing a 51-year-old Assistant Town Planner during a demolition drive in Himachal Pradesh's Kasauli, was arrested by Solan police from Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, on Thursday, 3 May,   reported. The accused had allegedly been on the run since the murder. Additional Superintendent of Police, Solan, Shiv Kumar, who headed the SIT formed to investigate the case, told   that the accused was being brought to Solan for investigation. He will be produced before the court on Friday, 4 May. “The accused, Vijay Singh, was arrested from Mathura-Vrindavan area this evening. It was a joint effort of the Himachal Pradesh Police and a Delhi Police special team,” Solan SP Mohit Chawla told PTI. Shaila Bala Sharma was allegedly shot dead in Kasauli on 1 May by Kumar while she was carrying out a Supreme Court-mandated drive to demolish illegal structures in 13 hotels. Gulab Singh, a Public Works Department employee, was also injured when Kumar, a hotel owner, allegedly opened fire. The Himachal Police had also announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh to anyone who could provide information about the accused hotelier. The accused had also sent a text message saying he was going to surrender to the police,   reported. According to   the hotelier said that even though he had pleaded with Sharma, with his mother even touching her feet to spare his building, ""she refused to settle"" and ""was behaving like an ideal officer.” The Supreme Court on Wednesday, 2 May, first took suo moto cognisance of the killing of the officer, who was monitoring court-order hotel demolition drive in Kasuali. Earlier on Thursday, the apex court pulled up the state government for allowing relentless illegal construction in the state. The apex court rapped the state government for not providing adequate security to the official. Terming it a “serious issue,” the apex court said it might stop passing orders if it was going to kill people, reported ANI. ""It's a brazen act of defiance of court order,” the SC said. Earlier, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur had said his government will submit a status report in the apex court on 3 May and that a divisional commissioner will investigate into the matter. According to  , he had also said: “The law and order will be maintained at all costs in the state.” The mortal remains of the deceased were handed over to the family members in Shimla, reported ANI. The mother of the hotelier told  that she was worried for her son but wanted him to surrender. Devi also told ANI that his son had been disturbed since many days. The Supreme Court had, on 17 April, directed the state government to demolish unauthorised structures in 13 hotels in Kasauli and Dharampur areas of Solan, and four teams were constituted for this purpose. An altercation ensued and Kumar fired three rounds at the officials, killing Sharma on the spot and injuring Singh, who is undergoing treatment at PGI, Chandigarh, where his condition is stated to be critical. The accused fled from the scene soon after and a manhunt was reportedly launched to nab him. Superintendant of Police (Solan) Mohit Chawla said a case was registered against the accused and checking at all interstate barriers was intensified. Meanwhile, amid adequate security, the demolition teams continued to pull down unauthorised constructions, and in some cases, hotel owners took the initiative and removed illegal structures on their own.

"On the second day of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) national executive meeting in Delhi on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for "" "" (Invincible India, Resolute BJP) and launched a strong attack on the Opposition, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

The prime minister added that the alliance of Opposition parties is characterised by an absence of leadership, unclear policy and corrupt ethical standards, Prasad said. Earlier on Sunday, the BJP projected the Lok Sabha polls as a battle between a ""daydreaming"" Opposition and the National Democratic Alliance, whose leader Narendra Modi has an ""approval rating"" of over 70 percent and is set to build a ""New India"" by 2022. ""The prime minister said it is important to have an Opposition in a democracy, so that it holds the government accountable. However, he remarked that those who had been failures in power had also turned out to be failures in Opposition,"" Prasad said. Modi also said that the Opposition should challenge the government on issues of ideology and policy, but rued that it challenges the government based on ""lies"". ""Repeating lies has become a habit of sorts for the Opposition,"" Prasad quoted the prime minister as saying. During the meet on Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah said, ""We will win the 2019 polls, and after victory in the 2019 polls, nobody will be able to remove us for the next 50 years.

He said that there are no links between the Congress and the analytics company and added that the BJP's accusations were a way for them to deflect the truth. He said that the Narendra Modi-led dispensation themselves had used the 'stolen data to manipulate elections'. ""The BJP government has now become a manufacturer of fake news and an epitome of post-truth. The BJP-JD(U)-Cambridge Analytica nexus has now been exposed,"" Surjewala said.

On Thursday, launching a direct attack on Rahul Gandhi in a press conference, Prasad had questioned why the Congress president failed to clarify his party's links with Cambridge Analytics when the articles first appeared last year. ""When they are caught, they are saying we have no connections with the company,"" he said.

"Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been controversy's favourite politician ever since he took over the state's command. Apart from facing constant bickering for his allegiance to the pro-Hindutva agenda and open saffron embrace, Adityanath has faced very often flak for poor state administration amid a deteriorating law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh. Yogi who had been projected as the face of BJP's communal outreach in the northern belt was later deputed campaigning work for Assembly elections in Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Karnataka and most recently in the Palghar bypoll. So even as the Opposition continues to label him as an 'RSS pracharak' and target him for 'bhagwa rajeneeti', he continues to be BJP's go-to-man for pre-poll strategies. And all this while he grapples to keep things together in his state in the midst of frequent natural calamities like dust storms and mishaps such as the Kushinagar school bus accident. Thus it is no surprise that Adityanath, time and again, has put the blame of rising communal tension in the state on the 'divisive politics' of opposition parties. But consecutive losses in by elections have pushed the BJP government to a corner with rising resentment against Yogi's style of governance and doubts on his waning popularity. Soon after BJP lost the Kairana and Noorpur by elections on Thursday, BJP MLA Shyam Prakash took to Facebook to criticise the Yogi government. In a rather amusing poem  , Prakash has not only accused the BJP of ""corruption"" but has also called-out the Yogi-led govt for winning the election in the name of Modi and later derailing from their agenda of people's welfare. However, for the majority, he still remains a party favourite. According to a  , BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, “The Uttar Pradesh chief minister is a popular figure among the north Indian residents in the city. His campaigns in the urban areas will surely help us."" But this is not the first time, Adityanath has   for mismanagement in his state. He earlier faced heat, when Narendra Modi himself reprimanded him over ""simmering revolt of Dalit MPs, loss in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections and general lacklustre performance of the state government"" in April this year. In a separate meeting then, party chief Amit Shah also rapped on his knuckles. In September 2017 too, Modi and Shah took Yogi to task after women students protesting against sexual violence on the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) campus were baton-charged by the police. It doesn't help then that Yogi, according to at least  , has been accused of violently turning away people from his 'Janta Darbar'. In fact, two BJP MPs in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accused Yogi of ""scolding"" them and ""asking to get out"". As Ashok K Singh  , ""Yogi lacks the manner in which Modi can transcend ideological rigidity to carry the people along. As the mahant of Gorakhnath temple, Yogi has not learnt the art of political persuasion. His ability to make outreach to the people who feel alienated from his administration is severely limited"". He even went on to label him as ""an albatross around Modi’s neck"".",FP Staff
" Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday lashed out at the Maharashtra government led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, saying it was ""good for nothing"", and demanded a separate home minister for the state. At present, Fadnavis holds the home portfolio. Thackeray's comments came after a local Sena leader, Sachin Sawant, was shot dead on 22 April. Prior to it, two Shiv Sena leaders were shot dead earlier this month in Ahmednagar district after the result of a civic bypoll there was announced. ""The Fadnavis government is good for nothing. The situation here is worse than that in Bihar. It is now time the government appoints a separate home minister for the state,"" Thackeray said, addressing reporters in Ahmednagar district. He demanded that noted lawyer Ujjwal Nikam take up the case of killings of two Sena leaders in Ahmednagar. Thackeray said he had spoken to Nikam about it. ""If a Sainik takes law in his hands against a gangster, a case should not be lodged against us. This should be the responsibility of the administration,"" Thackeray said and demanded death penalty for those behind the killings of Sena leaders.

": The Shiv Sena on Tuesday decided not to align with the BJP and go solo in the 2019 Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly polls, declaring that it had so far not contested elections outside the state to keep the Hindu vote together but that would no longer be the case. The Sena, which had stayed away from other states to ensure that the Hindu vote did not get divided, would in future contest all Assembly polls, irrespective of the outcome, said party chief Uddhav Thackeray. He also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for flying kites with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu instead of focusing on insurgency-hit Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP government was spending money only on advertisements, Thackeray alleged and said such a dispensation should be brought down. The Sena has shared an uneasy alliance with the BJP at the Centre and in Maharashtra. The resolution to part ways with the BJP and go it alone in the elections next year was tabled by Sena MP Sanjay Raut at the party's National Executive meeting. ""I move the resolution for the Shiv Sena to fight the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls on its own in 2019,"" Raut said while tabling the resolution, which was passed unanimously. He said the party would win at least 25 Lok Sabha seats (out of a total 48 in Maharashtra) and 150 Assembly seats (out of a total 288) in the state. ""The BJP allied with the Sena in the name of Hindutva and the Sena kept its patience for Hindutva. However, the BJP in the last three years has been demoralising the Sena and using power to do so,"" Raut said. Senior Sena leaders backed Raut's resolution. The Shiv Sena held its internal polls to elect its party president and other functionaries on Tuesday, the birth anniversary of its founder Bal Thackeray. It also elevated Aaditya Thackeray Thackeray as ""party leader"", making him a part of the core team. The party also passed a resolution to elevate Milind Narvekar, personal assistant of Uddhav, as party secretary. Narvekar, an enigmatic figure for those in the political circles, has often played a crucial role in discussions of the Sena with its ally BJP. Uddhav Thackeray, who was re-elected Sena president, criticised Modi's recent camaraderie with Netanyahu in Ahmedabad and said the nation would have been proud if he had hoisted the tricolour in Srinagar rather than flying kites. ""Why did you have to take the Israeli prime minister to Ahmedabad? What purpose did it serve? The nation would have been proud of you had you taken him (Netanyahu) to Srinagar and hoisted the tricolour there or taken him to Lal Chowk and hoisted the flag there,"" said Thackeray. This government, he said, spends money on advertisements but seemingly nothing on the actual implementation of schemes and should be brought down if it was doing so. ""If killing a cow is a crime and is banned, then speaking lies for power should also be considered a sin and be stopped,"" he said. Thackeray also took up the issue of Pakistan. ""Today, we do not know if the country is going forward or backward. The environment in the country is such that Pakistan has become an election issue. The neighbouring country was also brought in for Gujarat elections there is no co-relation between the two,"" Thackeray said. The situation became such that Pakistan had to formally ask India not to drag it in its internal issues, he said. According to the Sena chief, despite Modi's promises of 'acche din', soldiers were sacrificing their lives everyday and their mutilated bodies were being brought to their native places and consigned to flames. ""However, we just give talks about teaching Pakistan a lesson every time. Once and for all, take concrete action rather than just talk,"" Thackeray said. He also slammed Union minister Nitin Gadkari for his recent remarks on defence personnel. If Gadkari does not want to accept their demands, the BJP should also not take credit for the surgical strikes, he said. Gadkari had on 11 January said that ""not an inch"" of land would be given for Navy housing in south Mumbai, wondering why all their personnel here want to stay in the posh area when they should be at Pakistan border. Gadkari had made the remark while voicing his disappointment at the Navy's objection to a floating jetty plan at Malabar Hill in south Mumbai, where a floating hotel and seaplane service are planned. Thackeray said, ""If you say you are the government and the army personnel should go to the border rather than make demands, why did you take undue credit for the surgical strikes? Did you even go at the border then?"" ""People are saying you came to power by indulging in scams. The Army not just has a 56-inch chest, but valour as well,"" he said.",PTI

"Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot on Friday said a chapter in a school textbook in the state that calls freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar Tilak the “father of terrorism” was an insult to the nation,   reported.  He asked the state government to immediately remove the chapter and ban the book. “It is very unfortunate that syllabus in school books is being misrepresented damaging the image of freedom fighters,” Pilot said. “The same BJP government earlier tried to delete chapter on first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru from school books and then retracted when Congress opposed it aggressively.” So much for a self proclaiming ""nationalist"" BJP government.  The book, which was brought out by a Mathura-based publisher, says on page 267: “Tilak demonstrated a path towards national movement, therefore, he is called as the father of terrorism.” Historians criticised the mischaracterisation of the freedom fighter. “Tilak is one of the greatest soldiers of Indian freedom struggle who awakened Indian masses, especially in Maharashtra, to fight against tyrannical British rule,” NK Upadhyay, retired professor of history at Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati University in Ajmer, told  .

" Vivek Gupta Taking after the initial weeks that succeeded demonetisation – announced by the Narendra Modi government – non-availability of cash in ATMs have been reported in several states across India including poll-bound Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The national capital New Delhi has reportedly been hit by the cash crunch as well. The Reserve Bank of India issued a circular clarifying that there is no currency shortage. It said there is sufficient cash in the RBI vaults and currency chests and printing of the notes has been ramped up in all the four note presses. Finance Minister Arun jaitley, earlier confirming the shortage, had assured that there was adequate currency in circulation. He said that the shortage was triggered by a ‘sudden and unusual’ increase in demand. Talking to BloombergQuint, Principal Economic Adviser Sanjeev Sanyal refused to comment on the causes for the currency shortage. He also said that there has been some evidence of hoarding as judged by the volume of currency coming back to the banking system. Sanyal said, “We were surprised by the sudden spike in demand but we are more than in a position to supply whatever cash is necessary for whatever reason by the public at large.” Minister of State for Finance Pratap Shukla, speaking to ANI, also confirmed the cash crunch situation, and said that it will be resolved in three days. He added that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also formed a committee to transfer currency from one state to another. Slamming the government, Congress President Rahul Gandhi told ANI that Modi has destroyed the banking system. After Gandhi, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien also slammed the BJP government accusing them of not being able to improve the cash situation in the country even after 1.5 years of demonetisation. SBI Chairman Ranjish Kumar said that the crunch was mainly due to “geographical” factors and that the situation will soon return to normalcy. He added that the RBI also intends to add more Rs 500 notes in circulation. The Department of Economic Affairs reacted to the cash crunch saying that the government is prepared to meet the higher demand in coming days. To deal with the situation, Economic Affairs Secretary S C Garg said the RBI would increase five-fold printing of Rs 500 notes to about Rs 2,500 crore a day. ""So, in a month, we will be printing about Rs 70,000-Rs 75,000 crore. This should give you assurance that we are geared up to meet the rising demand,"" he said. Garg noted that there is also a perception that there may be shortage of currency in the future. So people have started withdrawing and it has contributed to the crisis, he added. According to him, currency in stock is about Rs 2 lakh crore and these reserves are adequate to meet any unusual spurt in demand. He assured that there was no reason for anyone to fear or any apprehension that either private sector or public sector banks are in danger. ""Our banking is totally safe and people should not have in any apprehension in keeping deposits,"" he said. In Prime Minister Modi’s constituency Varanasi, people complained that they are unable to pay school fees and purchase groceries. In Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal, however, citizens claim cash crunch has been prevalent for the last 15 days. “We are facing a cash crunch. ATMs are not dispensing cash. The situation has been the same since 15 days. We have visited several ATMs today as well, to no avail,” they said. In Gujarat’s Vadodara, people complained that very few ATMs were working, and one could withdraw only Rs 10,000 from a working ATM. In Hyderabad, a person waiting to withdraw cash told ANI: “We are facing cash crunch. Most of the ATMs are not dispensing cash, the ones which are dispensing, have only Rs 500 notes. We are facing difficulty, don’t know what to do,” said a citizen of Delhi, speaking to ANI. General Secretary of Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association (MGBEA) Janak Rawal told   that “farmers, dairy producers and villagers bank with rural co-operative banks who get their cash replenishment from currency chest branches. But now that chest branches are running dry, where will the co-operative banks meet their cash requirement? This is peak season at APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) markets and farmers are suffering”. President of the Gujarat Farmers Association (Gujarat Khedut Samaj) Sagar Rabari told  , “The traders are using cash crunch as an excuse to buy at low rates. Even dairy farmers are not able to get cash from their accounts and there is a 10-day pay cycle”. Meanwhile, Gujarat’s Chief Secretary J N Singh told   that the state government is in touch with the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India and all necessary measures are being taken to normalise the cash flow. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan earlier on Monday, 16 April, claimed that Rs 2,000 notes were vanishing from the market, and alleged that there was a ""conspiracy"" behind it. “But notes of Rs 2,000 are missing from the market,” Chouhan added, possibly referring to news reports of ATMs running out of cash at some places in the state. ""Where these notes of Rs 2,000 denomination are going, who are keeping them out of circulation? Who are the persons creating shortfall of cash? This is a conspiracy to create problems. The government will act tough on this,"" he said. Bihar Finance Minister Sushil Modi told ANI that there has been a cash crunch since the past five to six days in the state’s banks. He added, “I spoke to officials at both RBI and banks, they said that in the next few days problem will be sorted. RBI said less supply has caused a problem and it will be solved in a day or two”.

" The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on June 29 contended in the Madras high court that the trial court was wrong in discharging former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi and other accused in the “illegal” telephone exchange case, saying a prima facie case had been made out against them. Commencing arguments on the CBI’s appeal filed against the trial court’s March 14 order before Justice G. Jayachandran, the agency’s counsel Srinivasan accused Dayanidhi of having abused his official position to obtain a large number of telephone connections and allowing them to be commercially used by Sun Network-owned by Kalanithi Maran during 2004-06. The rules permitted only three landline connections and two mobile connections to the minister and the number of free calls was also limited, he submitted. But bills were never raised by the BSNL for the connections obtained by the then minister treating them as service connections, which was illegal, the CBI counsel said. “Practically, a single person cannot use hundreds of phone connections. Therefore, it must have obviously been used by some other person and that some other person is Sun TV,” he contended. Earlier, the judge refused a plea by the counsel for Maran brothers to adjourn the hearing on the appeal till next month end due to non-availability of senior counsels. The senior counsels who were to appear on behalf of the Maran brothers were out of the country, the council said. “The CBI took three months to file this appeal after the trial court’s order. We need a reasonable time to go through the voluminous affidavit filed by the CBI, he said. However, Justice Jayachandran rejected the plea and noted that three weeks’ time was sufficient to read the case documents and arrange for the appearance of senior counsels from Delhi. The judge also directed the counsels on either side to cooperate with the court for speedy disposal of the appeal. He then posted the matter to July 17 for further hearing. The special judge for CBI cases on March 14 had discharged all seven accused from the case, saying there was no prima facie case against them. The CBI had alleged that an illegal private telephone exchange was set up at the city residence of Dayanidhi during 2004-06 when he was the telecom minister and it was used for the business transactions of the Sun Network. The central agency had alleged that Dayanidhi had caused a loss of Rs 1.78 crore to the exchequer. Other accused who have been discharged are former BSNL general manager K. Brahmanathan, former deputy general manager M.P. Velusamy, Dayanidhi Maran’s private secretary Gauthaman and Sun TV officials.",PTI
"Former BJP leader, and a recent inductee into the Congress party Manvendra Singh will take on Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan’s Jhalrapatan constituency, the party’s second list revealed on Saturday, 17 November. Expressing his gratitude over the Congress’s decision, Manvendra Singh said: Singh, who is the son of Jaswant Singh – one of the founding members of the BJP, joined the Congress last month, signaling a big boost for the latter ahead of the elections.

": A video clip purportedly showing an autorickshaw driver being shoved aside, while questioning Tamil Nadu BJP chief Tamilisai Soundararajan over rising fuel prices, has gone viral Monday. In the brief clip a man emerges from behind the gathering and moves towards Soundararajan fielding questions from reporters. He can be heard asking her about the rising fuel prices and immediately a party functionary shoves him aside. Soundararajan answers the question but does not turn around to see the man who posed the question. She was speaking to reporters after the conclusion of a cultural event here involving folk artistes in the early hours to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday. When contacted, the BJP state unit chief told  , ""the man was not manhandled as is being claimed by some channels. I did not even see him, but I did answer his question."" Since the identity of the man was not known and as it was about 12.30 am, party workers as part of security measures took him away, she said. Later, the auto driver told reporters that he was ""misunderstood,"" by the BJP men. ""I only tried to vent my grievance.The petrol price hike is hurting drivers like me more."" He said he does not own an autorickshaw and only hires it for a daily fee. ""We have to buy fuel at a high cost and try to make ends meet which is becoming impossible,"" he added.",Press Trust of India
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in the middle of his high-voltage campaign for the BJP in Karnataka, directed his ammunition mostly on the Congress on 2 and 3 May, which was on expected lines. However, there was a marked difference in Modi's tone as compared to his statements on 1 May with respect to the JD(S). Days after castigating Congress president Rahul Gandhi for ""insulting"" former prime minister   by calling the JD(S) the ""B team"" of the BJP, Modi on Thursday asked people not to ""waste"" their votes by backing Gowda's party as it was going to finish ""a poor, distant third"" in the elections. On 1 May, Modi had said, ""I heard the Congress president speak at political rallies 15-20 days ago....the way he referred to respected Deve Gowda ....is this your culture (sanskar)? This is arrogance...Your life (as Congress chief) has just begun. Deve Gowda is among the tallest leaders of the country. You are insulting him."" Two days later, the prime minister was less charitable in his statements about the JD(S). He accused the party of doing a ""disservice"" by forming an alliance with forces of extremism and communalism. He said it would not win the assembly polls in the state under any circumstances and quoted political pundits, saying they had predicted that Gowda's party would be a ""distant third"", that too after ""limping."" While Modi's more recent remarks were in Bengaluru, his earlier remarks were in Udupi. Modi's earlier statement about Deve Gowda had led to a flurry of political reactions. Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma alleged there was an ""opportunistic understanding and unholy nexus"" with the JD(S) that the prime minister and BJP chief Amit Shah had sought and created. Deve Gowda, on his part,   to the prime minister's praise with warmth, saying, ""Before the 2014 elections, I had said I would resign from Lok Sabha if BJP gets a majority on its own. I decided to resign, but Modi persuaded me against doing so. He said the country needs the experience and services of senior leaders."" Narendra Modi in Bengaluru accused the Siddaramaiah government of having turned the city into a ""garbage city and valley of sin"" from ""Silicon Valley. He said that a talented pool of youngsters in Karnataka made this city the computer capital, but in the last five years, the Congress government turned Bengaluru into a ""crime capital."" The youth with entrepreneurial tendency made Bengaluru a startup, but Congress turned it into a ""pothole club,"" Modi said. The state was given Rs 836 crore by the central government under the 'Smart City' project to develop Bengaluru, but the state could spend only Rs 12 crore on the city, he lamented. The cosmopolitan city of Bengaluru was being destroyed by the Congress through its ""corruption and culture of chaos"", the prime minister alleged. Of the 224 Assembly segments, the capital city alone has 28 seats. In the 2013 elections, the Congress won 13, BJP 12 and JD-S 3. The Karnataka government is a ""gold medalist"" in corruption and Congress leaders are ""drunk on power"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Bengaluru. He also flayed the Congress for ""insulting"" national heroes and the Army. Modi alleged that the Congress had insulted the Indian Army by questioning the truth behind 2016 surgical strikes against terrorists in Pakistan. ""After surgical strikes, our Army Chief was called a goon by the Congress. I want to ask you, in our country, has even an uneducated person committed the sin of calling our brave soldiers goons?"" He said the Congress was spreading ""lies"" by accusing the BJP of being anti-Dalit, anti-Muslim and anti-women. ""We made a Dalit, the President of India, gave the country its first woman defence minister. They spread lies that we are from the Hindi belt and have nothing to do with the south. But our Vice-President is a south Indian."" He said the BJP gave India a Muslim President in APJ Abdul Kalam and the Congress could not even deliver on making its senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge, the Chief Minister — as promised in the last Assembly election. While the BJP has been at the receiving end of anger among the farmer community in several states, it has been on the offensive on the issue in Karnataka. Narendra Modi, during his campaign has repeatedly made references to agrarian distress in the southern state. On 2 May, he came down hard on the Siddaramaiah government in poll-bound Karnataka for being ""indifferent"" to farm distress and not implementing the crop insurance scheme effectively and stressed that welfare of farmers was his government's top priority. Assailing the Siddaramaiah government for its alleged failure in tackling drought, Modi said instead of mitigating the suffering of farmers, it gave parched lakes to builders for construction activity. ""Helping and serving farmers is an opportunity that comes with good fortune, but the Karnataka government's game is only to do politics in the name of farmers, instigate them, and spread false information,"" he said. Calling BJP's chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa a ""farmer leader"", Modi said his vast experience and commitment to the farming community will strengthen the Centre's mission to give a fresh impetus to agriculture. ""The people of Karnataka are well aware of Yeddyurappa's commitment to farmers. The BJP government that will come to power and the BJP government in Delhi that is committed to the cause of farmers will work together to bring a change,"" he said.",FP Staff
" Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will spend his MP area development funds on Rae Bareli, a move being seen as an attempt by the BJP to breach the Gandhi family bastion in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. 'Representative' of Arun Jaitley and Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Hero Bajpai told  , ""Almost a month back, Jaitley had chosen Rae Bareli district as a Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh. The backwardness of the district, despite being represented by a prominent political family, and the various demands which have been emanating from the district, prompted Jaitley   to choose it."" Under the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), each MP has the choice to suggest to the district collector for works to the tune of Rs 5 crore per annum to be taken up in his/her constituency. A Rajya Sabha MP can recommend works in one or more districts in the state from where he/she has been elected. Bajpai said, ""The Union finance minister may tour Rae Bareli in the first or second week of November."" However, Bajpai ruled out any possibility of a battle in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections between Sonia Gandhi and Arun Jaitley. ""He (Jaitley) will not contest the Lok Sabha elections, but will strengthen the BJP in the Congress bastion,"" Jaitley's representative said. The people in Rae Bareli have been demanding a stadium, a university, solar lights and solar energy-operated pumps in remote villages of the district, Bajpai said, and added that efforts would be made to fulfil all the incomplete works in the district so that people could heave a sigh of relief. He also said Rs 2.5 crore had already reached the chief development officer of Rae Bareli (the nodal person to carry out the works using the MPLADS funds). Rae Bareli is currently represented by Sonia Gandhi in the Lok Sabha, while the neighbouring parliamentary constituency of Amethi is represented by Rahul Gandhi (current Congress president). Prior to this, Indira Gandhi had won from Rae Bareli in 1980, while her elder son Rajiv Gandhi had represented Amethi in Lok Sabha in 1984, 1989 and 1991. Sanjay Gandhi had won from Amethi in 1980. ""Rae Bareli, which remained in darkness, as development eluded it during the the Congress rule, has now started experiencing the first rays of development touching its soil. Whenever any stalwart leader enters a district, it adds a new dimension to the growth saga of the district,"" Bajpai said, claiming that people of Rae Bareli are happy that the Union finance minister will be spending his MP area development funds on the district. Jaitley's representative also said, ""This will help the BJP achieve its mission of bagging more than 73 Lok Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 general elections."" Uttar Pradesh sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, the BJP won 71 seats, its ally Apna Dal got two, while the SP bagged five and the Congress won the remaining two. Union textiles minister Smriti Irani, during a recent visit to Amethi and Rae Bareli last month, had attacked the Gandhi family for the lack of development in its stronghold. She had accused the two Congress leaders of failing to develop their own constituencies, claiming that 70 to 80 percent of houses were still made of mud. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Sonia Gandhi had bagged 5,26,434 votes and defeated her BJP rival by a margin of 3,52,713 votes.",Press Trust of India

"New Delhi:  Within hours of it being cleared by the Union Cabinet on Saturday, President Ram Nath Kovind late last night promulgated the Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance that will allow the government to confiscate properties and assets of loan defaulters who flee the country. The Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on March 12, but could not be taken up for discussion and passage due to the logjam in Parliament over various issues. The ordinance seeks to confiscate properties of economic offenders like diamond merchants Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, who have left the country to avoid facing criminal prosecution. The provisions of the ordinance will apply for economic offenders who refuse to return, persons against whom an arrest warrant has been issued for a scheduled offence as well as willful bank loan defaulters with outstanding of over ₹100 crore. It provides for confiscating assets even without a conviction and paying off lenders by selling off the fugitive’s properties. Such economic offenders will be tried under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ordinance defines a fugitive economic offender as a person against whom an arrest warrant has been issued for committing offence like counterfeiting government stamps or currency, cheque dishonour for insufficiency of funds, money laundering, and transactions defrauding creditors. A fugitive economic offender is one who has left the country to avoid facing prosecution, or refuses to return to face prosecution. According to the ordinance, a director or deputy director (appointed under the PMLA, 2002) may file an application before a special court (designated under the 2002 Act) to declare a person as a fugitive economic offender. The application will contain the reasons to believe that an individual is a fugitive economic offender. Besides, the application will have information about his whereabouts, a list of properties believed to be proceeds of a crime for which confiscation is sought, a list of benami properties or foreign properties for which confiscation is sought, and a list of persons having an interest in these properties. Upon receiving the application, the special court will issue a notice to the individual, requiring him to appear at a specified place within six weeks. If the person appears at the specified place, the special court will terminate its proceedings under the provisions of the Bill. Any property belonging to the fugitive economic offender may provisionally be attached without the prior permission of the special court, provided that an application is filed before the court within 30 days.",PTI
"The Congress on Thursday, 17 May, sought the recall of Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala, after Bharatiya Janata Party’s B S Yeddyurappa was sworn in as the chief minister of the state. The Congress, which in alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular), had made a bid to form the government in the state, referred to a 2011 tweet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the recall of the then Karnataka governor and said, ""We agree"". Modi and his BJP had sought the recall of the then governor, H R Bhardwaj, alleging that he was ""harassing"" the BJP-led state government and ""acting in a partisan manner"". Meanwhile, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said the fate of Karnataka's new chief minister is sealed in his letter given to Governor Vajubhai Vala as it makes no mention of a number bigger than the 104 MLAs of the BJP. His comment came after the Supreme Court said government formation in the state would be subject to the final outcome of the case before it. The former finance and home minister said had he been in Yeddyurappa's place, he would not have taken the oath till the apex court took a decision on the petition filed by the Congress-JD(S) combine challenging the governor's decision to invite him to take oath. The Supreme Court had refused to stay Yeddyurappa's swearing-in as the chief minister after a rare pre-dawn hearing, which saw the Congress-JD (S) combine making a last-ditch attempt to stall the saffron party's surge in the southern state. The apex court, which commenced the hearing at 2:11 am and ended it at 5:28 am, however, made it clear that the swearing-in and government formation in the state would be subject to the final outcome of the case before it. The petition said the Congress-JD (S) combine has the majority in the House with 117 MLAs while the BJP has only 104 seats, which was below the majority mark of 112 at present.

"Separatists on Thursday, 17 May, termed the Centre's announcement to cease anti-terror operations by security forces in Jammu & Kashmir during Ramzan and reserving the right to retaliate if attacked, a ‘cruel joke’.

" BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday accused the Congress of supporting ""Urban Naxals"" and said his party will put Maoists in jail if it is voted to power in Telangana. ""Urban Naxals"" is a term used to describe city-based supporters working in alleged front organisations of proscribed Maoist outfits. Addressing a public meeting in Nirmal district, Shah said, ""Recently they (Urban Naxals) were arrested in Maharashtra. The BJP government there, led by Devendra Fadnavis, put them behind bars, but Rahul Gandhi supported them."" ""Rahul baba, are you aware that hundreds of people in Telangana have died due to Naxalism?"" he asked. The BJP chief claimed Maoists were ""hiding"" in different parts of the state and said his party would look for them and send them to prison. ""They have only two options — either join the mainstream or get ready to face jail,"" Shah said. He also trained his guns at Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief and the state's caretaker chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, popularly known as KCR, for demanding reservation for minorities. The BJP chief said Rao-led Telangana government had forwarded a   reservation for minorities despite knowing that it is not possible to do so. ""You don't worry. Even if KCR, the Congress, the TDP and Communists come together, I guarantee that till the BJP government is in the Centre, religion-based reservation will not be granted,"" Shah said.

"The United States on Thursday suspended security assistance to Pakistani military and demanded “decisive action” against Taliban factions based in the country. Pakistan now will not receive almost $1.3 billion (Rs 8,238 crore) in annual aid,   reported. “Until the Pakistani government takes decisive action against groups, including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network, that are destabilising the region and targeting US personnel, the United States will suspend security assistance to the Pakistani military,” US Department of State spokesperson Heather Nauert said. Until the   government takes decisive action against groups, including the Afghan   and the   Network, that are destabilizing the region and targeting U.S. personnel, the United States will suspend security assistance to the Pakistani military. The president had made it clear in his South Asia policy   in August 2017 that there could be no partnership with countries that harbour militants who target US service members and officials, Nauert said. “More than four months later, these groups still find sanctuary inside Pakistan,” she added. The State Department official acknowledged that Pakistan had been the target of terrorist attacks, but added that the US needs Islamabad “to deny safe haven to, or lawfully detain, those who threaten US interests”. “We hope to renew and deepen our bilateral security relationship when Pakistan demonstrates willingness to aggressively confront Afghan Taliban, Haqqani Network, and others who operate from its territory,” Nauert said.   We are ready to work w/   to combat all terrorists w/o distinction. We hope to renew & deepen our bilateral security relationship when Pakistan demonstrates willingness to aggressively confront Afghan  ,   Network, and others who operate from its territory. In response, the Pakistan Foreign Office on Friday   that Islamabad fought the war against terrorism “largely from its own resources”, at a cost of $120 billion (Rs 7.6 lakh crore) in 15 years.  “We believe that Pakistan-US cooperation in fighting terrorism has directly served US national security interests as well as the larger interests of international community,” the Pakistani statement read. “It has helped decimate Al-Qaeda and fight other groups who took advantage of ungoverned spaces, a long porous border and posed a common threat to peace.” The Pakistan Foreign Office said that the country awaited “reciprocal action” by Afghanistan in the form of “clearance of vast stretches of ungoverned spaces on the Afghan side, bilateral border management, repatriation of Afghan refugees, controlling poppy cultivation, drug trafficking and initiating Afghan-led and owned political reconciliation”. In a dig at the US administration, the foreign office added that “arbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goalposts are counterproductive in addressing common threats” the two countries face. However, it said that the impact of the US decision to halt funding to Pakistan would become clear only in due course of time. On January 1, US President Donald Trump   that Pakistan had given his country nothing but “lies and deceit” in return for $33 billion (Rs 2.10 lakh crore) in aid over the last 15 years. Pakistani Defence Minister Khurram Dastgir-Khan had   the US president’s tweet on January 1 and said that though Islamabad was its ally, America has given it nothing but invective and mistrust.

"The Supreme Court on Wednesday, 26 September, declared the Centre's flagship Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid – but struck down some of its provisions, including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions. Among other exceptions was the apex court’s decision to strike down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act. What does it mean? It means that private companies cannot use Aadhaar. The Congress, though silent on other developments, lauded the top court’s decision for the amendment to the Aadhaar Act. Congress president Rahul Gandhi hailed the judgment while slamming the BJP for making Aadhaar an “instrument of oppression”. The BJP, meanwhile, also hailed the Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar as a big victory for the ""pro-poor Modi government"", saying the apex court has upheld the constitutional validity of the scheme and asserted that it does not violate privacy. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said everyone criticising Aadhaar should understand “that they cannot defy technology”. “Mainstream should accept changes, one can understand the fringe being against,” he was quoted as saying by ANI. “Congress cuts a very sorry figure here, they introduced the idea but they did not know what to do with it,” he added. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra hit back at the Congress after it projected the verdict as a slap on the face of the ruling party, saying the order has in fact exposed the opposition party. The Congress favoured middlemen while the Modi government brought Aadhaar to ensure that benefits are given directly to people, he said. That is why, Patra added, the Congress had moved the apex court against it. The court has ruled that Aadhaar is safe. He said the court has noted that Aadhaar gives strength to the poor. The Supreme Court, like the Modi government, has stood with the poor of the country, the BJP leader added. Other BJP leaders also hailed the ‘historic’ judgment. Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “It's a historic judgment. The Supreme Court has clearly said Aadhaar doesn't lead to any kind of surveillance. Aadhaar is constitutionally valid, it empowers the poor with dignity. They have even upheld Aadhaar linking with PAN card.” Lashing out at the BJP dispensation after the verdict, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said that the “majority judgment in the Aadhaar case has retrieved the UPA's original idea of Aadhaar.” He said that several provisions of the Act and the Regulations had been struck down as unconstitutional and that it should serve as “a humbling lesson for the Ministry of Law.” Congress’ Randeep Singh Surjewala said the Supreme Court verdict ""upholds the individual's right to privacy"". Congress’ Kapil Sibal, too, “welcomed” the judgment. He told  , “Striking down linkage of bank accounts with Aadhaar is a very welcome step.” “By striking down Section 57 of Aadhaar Act, the Supreme Court has firmly put an end to the mass surveillance exercise being carried out under the guise of Aadhaar by the central government and the grotesque distortion of an idea conceived by the UPA,” he told  . “However, the passage of the law violates both the fundamental right to privacy and is a gross abuse of the Money Bill route,” he added. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, meanwhile, said Aadhaar on its own was “not the problem”. Speaking to , he said, “The problem is not Aadhaar, but linking of it to various things, where it was not actually needed. The Supreme Court has clarified saying Aadhaar linking is not needed for bank accounts and mobile number.” Several other Congress leaders also spoke on the judgment. “The delinking of Aadhaar from private entities is a 'slap on the face of the BJP’,” said Congress national spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi. He also hailed the Supreme Court's move to disallow metadata to be stored in its current form. Sanjay Jha, national spokeperson for INC India, slammed the Narendra Modi government for collecting citizen’s data while the matter was sub judice. “Dear Citizens of India. Ask (Narendra) Modi to ‘please give my data back’ that has been taken by mobile companies and banks. Why did the government take our Aadhaar information when it was sub judice? Now they already have access to your info. How fair is that? It is daylight robbery,” he said. The Trinamool Congress also hailed the Supreme Court judgment, which struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act that allowed corporate entities to access its data. A   released by the party after the judgment read: “SC strikes down Section 57 of Aadhaar Act, 2016. So you don’t need to give your Aadhaar to private bodies like banks, schools, mobile companies. Trinamool and Mamata Banerjee fought hard for this.” “Mamata Banerjee had issued an open challenge on Aadhaar. Our stance has been vindicated. I'm glad the SC said what it said. On data privacy and data protection, that's also something we need to take a close look at, so the BJP can't make it into a policed state,” TMC’s Derek O'Brien told ANI.

" The Rajya Sabha was on Tuesday adjourned for about 90 minutes following noisy protests by members of the Trinamool Congress, who stormed the Well demanding that black money stashed by Indians in Swiss Banks be brought back. The protests erupted during the Question Hour when TMC member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy sought to know from finance minister Piyush Goyal the unaccounted deposits of Indians recovered so far from Switzerland, in how many cases have proceedings have been initiated and when would the Indian people get the promised Rs 15 lakh in their bank account. ""I think the honourable member may have some information which the government does not have. If he is privy to any information about black money, I think he should put it before the government so that the government can take action,"" Goyal said in his reply to Roy's question. This provoked the TMC members who started raising slogans and some of them even moved into the Well. The ruckus, during which Congress MPs were also on their feet and protesting vociferously, led Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the House for about 90 minutes till 2 pm. In reply to the question on black money by Ram Kumar Kashyap of the INLD, Goyal said the money deposited by Indians in Swiss Banks had gone down by 80 per cent between 2013 and the end of 2017. He said the data collected by Swiss National bank in collaboration with Bank for International Settlements (BIS) show that loans and deposits of Indians, other than banks, in the Swiss banks declined by 34.5 per cent in 2017 as compared to 2016. Further, there has been a significant reduction in the Swiss non-bank loans and deposits of Indians by 80.2 per cent between 2013 and 2017, Goyal said in the written reply. He also said the Automatic Exchange of Information, based on Common Reporting Standard, has commenced from 2017 with many countries enabling India to receive financial account information of Indian residents. This will also be useful in bringing the unaccounted income and assets to tax, he said. In the written reply, Goyal said the disclosure of information received under a tax treaty was governed by the confidentiality provisions of the treaty.

" Dubbing the   on West Bengal panchayat polls as a ""victory of democracy and of the people"", Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday slammed the BJP, the Congress and the CPM for ""defaming"" the state through false propaganda. It was a planned move by the three political parties to gain political advantage, Banerjee said. Welcoming the Supreme Court's verdict, she said these parties had deliberately resorted to false propaganda. ""I think it is a victory of democracy and victory of the people. I want to dedicate it to the people of the country,"" Banerjee told reporters at the state secretariat. She said the CPM and the BJP moving the Supreme Court seeking cancellation of elections in over 20,000 uncontested local body seats in West Bengal had brought bad name to the state. ""It was a planned move by the CPM, the Congress and the BJP to malign the state and they have been doing it continuously,"" Banerjee, also the Trinamool Congress chief, said. The Supreme Court has turned down the pleas of the CPM and the BJP seeking cancellation of elections on over 20,000 uncontested local body seats in West Bengal. All the uncontested seats were won by candidates of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). The CPM and the BJP, which opposed the contention of the state government, state poll panel and the TMC, had alleged that West Bengal did not witness a free and fair election and the candidates of these two parties were stopped from filing nomination papers. Elections were held in phases for 48,650 posts in gram panchayats, 825 posts in zilla parishads and 9,217 posts in panchayat samitis and the TMC won about 34 percent seats uncontested.",Press Trust of India
": Protesting the manner in which the Odisha Assembly passed a resolution, Opposition Congress and BJP Tuesday boycotted the House and refused to return despite several requests by Speaker PK Amat. ""We are boycotting the House to protest the manner which the House passed a resolution without paying scant respect towards Opposition,"" Leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra of Congress said before leaving the House. The BJP members also followed and refused to return to the House even as two senior ministers and the government chief whip on behalf of the Speaker requested them to participate in the proceeding. As the Opposition members continued to remain away from the House, Speaker Amat adjourned the House twice for 15 minutes each. When they did not return, Speaker moved to the next business and asked Water Resources minister Niranjan Pujari to move Amendment to the Odisha Ground Water (Regulation, Development and Management) Bill, 2011. The dispute began when the House was discussing the resolution titled: ""This Assembly resolves to recommend the state government to move the Central government to include the 'Uniquely' Indian ideal of Ahimsa, of Non-Violence in the Preamble of India's Constitution."" The leader of Opposition welcomed the state government's gesture in bringing such a resolution. Mishra said he suggested to change wordings in the resolution ""I fail to understand what the resolution wordings mean. Let it be modified."" Mishra said that the Odisha Assembly should not be in a hurry to pass the resolution as nothing is urgent. ""We can discuss, deliberate and think on the implication of the resolution before passing it. Therefore, I request the government not to pass it in a haste,"" the Congress veteran said. He also suggested to bring the resolution in   language which will be understandable to all people in the state. Senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) member Ranendra Pratap Swain also supported Mishra's views and said he too failed to understand the wordings in the resolution. Swain said the resolution also do not suggest where to insert the word ""Ahimsa"" in the Preamble of the Constitution. BJP member Pradip Purohit, also welcomed the resolution, but asked the government to think over the wordings before it get nod of the House. Keeping the sentiments of the House, Parliamentary Affairs Minister BK Arukha, who moved the resolution on behalf of the Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, accepted the Opposition suggestions. ""Yes, we have decided to delete 'comma and of' after the word Ahimsa and put the word non-violence within bracket,"" Arukha said. The leader of the Opposition was not allowed to speak and Speaker hurriedly announced that the resolution is passed. Annoyed over the manner in which the Speaker announced the passing of the resolution, Mishra announced Opposition boycott action. Earlier, the House had unanimously passed another resolution titled: ""That this Assembly resolves to recommend the state government to move the Central Government in the Ministry of Civil Aviation to name the newly constructed Jharsuguda Airport in the state of Odisha as Veer Surendra Sai Airport."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the new airport at Jharsuguda on 22 September.",Press Trust of India
" In an act of rebellion, a group of AAP legislators led by Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Thursday declared the party's Punjab unit “autonomous” and “dissolved” its current organisational structure. But even while adopting this resolution at a public meeting, Khaira gave a week's time to the leadership in Delhi to review its decision to remove him from the post of Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly. Altogether, eight of the 20 AAP MLAs in Punjab took part in the “volunteers' convention” called by the Bolath legislator after his removal from the post. The AAP leadership had summoned all Punjab MLAs to Delhi on Thursday to indicate that they were not with Khaira's ""anti-party"" move. At least 11 of them came to meet the leaders in the capital, party leaders claimed. AAP state unit co-president Balbir Singh said the MLAs and other leaders who attended the Bathinda convention were ""misguided"" and hoped that they will fall in party line in coming days to strengthen the party. “Holding a convention under the banner of Aam Aadmi Party without consulting the state and centre leadership is illegal and the leaders must avoid such activities in future,"" he said in a statement. The dissidents' convention “unanimously resolved” that the party's Punjab unit was autonomous, and will take its own decisions. It “dissolved” the current organisational structure in the state and tasked the dissident MLAs and the convention organisers to frame a new one. One of the resolutions said the existing organisational structure had eroded the AAP's image and its base in the state. The convention flayed Khaira's removal as Leader of Opposition in an ""undemocratic way"" and rejected Cheema's appointment. Launching a veiled attack on top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia from the stage he shared with the seven other dissident MLAs, Khaira said, ""Punjab cannot be run by remote control."" 
Khaira said he does not accept the ""dictatorial"" approach adopted by the ""subedars"". ""I can sacrifice hundreds of such posts for the welfare of the people of Punjab,"" he said, addressing a sizeable gathering of supporters. Khaira proposed forging a third front of like-minded parties to rid Punjab of the Congress and the Akali Dal as they had ""ruined the state."" ""Power and money is in play in Punjab politics today,"" he said. He said he will start his “journey” by seeking blessings at the Golden Temple in Amritsar and will visit all 22 districts in the state. Rallies will be organised at various places, he said. He thanked the NRIs for their support in bringing the volunteers together and added that the other major parties are perplexed with the response they were getting. The other MLAs who expressed solidarity with Khaira are Kanwar Sandhu from Kharar, Nazar Singh Mansahia (Mansa), Kulwant Singh (Mehal Kalan), Baldev Singh (Jaitu), Pirmal Singh (Bhadaur), Jagdev Singh Kamalu (Maur) and Jagtar Singh Jagga (Raipur). The party plunged into a crisis in Punjab when Khaira was removed from his post in the Assembly on 26 July. AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu had earlier said 12-13 MLAs were expected to participate in the convention and claimed that the event was meant to ""strengthen"" the party. However, a tweet posted on AAP Punjab's twitter handle had said, ""AAP derives strength from its volunteers, likewise every volunteer has only one hero i.e. Arvind Kejriwal.” ""No volunteer will support a person who tries to break the emotional thread between Arvind Kejriwal and his army,"" it said.",Press Trust of India

The ossification test was conducted after the family of the accused failed to submit documents that could have helped the police ascertain whether he was a minor. The police had last week arrested the madrasa cleric for allegedly being aware of the girl’s presence on the premises.

" Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for raking up the Emergency, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said “contribution” of former premier Indira Gandhi for the country cannot be ignored just because of her 1975 decision. He also said that Gandhi was “pro-democracy” as she called for elections in 1977 after lifting Emergency which she lost. In his weekly column in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut said it would be “treason” to reject the contribution of national leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, BR Ambedkar, Netaji Bose and Veer Savarkar. “Nobody else performed so greatly in this country like (late) Indira Gandhi did. Her one decision of Emergency cannot wash away her contribution. It is a treason to reject the contribution of Pandit Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Dr Ambedkar, Netaji Bose and Veer Savarkar. Every government has to take some practical decision as per the situation. Who will decide what is wrong and right? Emergency ought to be forgotten,” Raut said. He said, “If the day when the Emergency was proclaimed by (then prime minister) India Gandhi is to be called ‘Black Day’, then there were many such ‘black days’ under the Central government. The day demonetisation was announced should also be called ‘Black Day’, as it created the economic anarchy.” Raut said many poor people lost their jobs for some days due to the note ban under which bank notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denominations were banned from circulation in November 2016. “Small traders incurred heavy losses. The cash with rich people turned ‘white’. Prime Minister had claimed that the note ban will bring out the black money, however, instead of black money coming out many people died while standing in queues,” he said. Raut said the BJP government’s promise that violence in Jammu and Kashmir would end has turned out to be hollow. “It was also said that violence in Kashmir will be ended. But, on the other hand, the violence in Kashmir has gone up. A bank, where BJP national president Amit Shah is one of the directors, received old notes of Rs 575 crore within five days from the announcement of the scrapping of the high value notes,” the Rajya Sabha MP said. He said the economy has not yet been recovered fully from the demonetisation impact. “The freedom of press was suppressed during the Emergency. Whatever is happening now a days is not different from the four-decade old emergency. During the Emergency, BJP leader LK Advani was put behind the bars. Today, (former prime minister Atal Bihari) Vajpayee is bed-ridden and Advani could not say anything. There are others who have now become mute. Have they become so on their own?” Raut asked. In a veiled attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sena leader said, “Only those who suffered like George Fernades during the Emergency have the right to speak against the measure. Fernandes not only went to jail but he was trying to attempt a revolutionary plan to topple authoritarian regime of Indira Gandhi”. The Shiv Sena leader also taunted Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had given a critical speech on 26 June on the 43rd anniversary of the Emergency in Mumbai, ahead of the prime minister. “Those who were not even born or were not even toddlers are today talking against Emergency and late Indira Gandhi. I am not a supporter or opponent of emergency. Even late Balasaheb Thackeray had supported the Emergency saying ‘if is makes the country more disciplined, then emergency is needed’. Despite that the printing press run by Thackeray was sealed during the emergency. It is a kind of sacrifice but Thackeray never sought credit for it or demanded pension,” Raut said. Raut said that in the earlier days of Emergency, all types of mafias, local goons and extortionists had been arrested which was appreciated by people. “During the Emergency period, civil servants started attending office on time. There was over activity in implementing mass sterilisation. Compulsory family planning of Muslims has been the agenda of Sangh Pariwar,” he said. He said underworld dons like Haji Mastan, Kareem lala, Yusuf Patel and Varada Rajan were sent to jail during the Emergency. “In contrast today, people like Nirav Modi and (Mehul) Choksi, both accused in the Punjab National Bank scam, and Vijay Mallya have fled the country after looting it,” Raut said. Claiming that RBI governor is being treated like a “puppet”, Raut referred to nationalisation of banks by Indira Gandhi who he said protected money of the common people through the move. “Today, Reserve Bank’s governor was treated as puppet and note ban was imposed. Many think that media owners and editors should bend down on their knees and speak,” he said. Raut said, “Modi thinks that there is some conspiracy being hatched against him. Indira Gandhi had thought the same. The country was in economic crisis after 1971 war of Bangladesh independence. She expected the Opposition to help her in such situation. It was not wrong but the Opposition decided to take advantage of such crisis”. Seeking to draw a parallel between Modi and Gandhi, Raut said the PM’s security has been increased in view of some “threats” to his life whereas Gandhi didn’t pay heed to warnings by the intelligence agencies about some Sikh security guards and got killed in 1984. “Language of (socialist leader) Jayprakash Narayan was also instigating in those days. He had appealed to the Army and police officials to not follow the orders of the government. Fernandes had used railway strike as a weapon. Then Railway minister Lalit Narayan Mishra was killed in a blast while judges and other ministers were also attacked,” Raut said referring to the turmoil ahead of the Emergency. He said Gandhi imposed the Emergency as she wanted to save the country from turning chaotic. “However, she was pro-democracy and hence she faced the elections after a couple of years and witnessed defeat. However, people re-elected her. If the day of her political defeat is to be celebrated as ‘Vijay Diwas’, then should her re-election be taken as ‘black day’?” he asked. Raut said Modi and the BJP are repeatedly targetting the Gandhis' because they are still afraid of the “skeleton” called Congress which could not win even 50 seats in the 2014 polls. “This is a sign of the weak mind. The government should talk about development and not about the Emergency which was proclaimed in 1975,” he said.",Press Trust of India
"Revoting at 568 polling booths for panchayat elections in West Bengal began on Wednesday, 16 May, on the direction of the State Election Commission (SEC) after violence ripped through the state, leaving 12 people dead and at least 43 injured on Monday. In Uttar Dinajpur district's Goalpokhar, the Rapid Action Force and police charged at the people after they agitated over the delay in revoting at booth number 36/37 on Wednesday, according to ANI. Some unidentified miscreants fled with a ballot box from booth number 76 in Malda's Ratua, another person brandished a gun, reported ANI. The body of Raj Kumar Ray, 33, presiding officer of a polling booth in the panchayat election, who had been missing since the polls on 14 May, was found beside railway tracks in Raiganj, in West Bengal's North Dinajpur district. The state government and the police have been asked to make elaborate security arrangements so that polling can be held in a free and fair manner, the SEC official said. The SEC official also said that the final voting percentage had gone up to 82.13 percent from 73 percent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had hit out at the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal over the violence, saying democracy was ""murdered"" for narrow political interests, PTI reported. Opposition parties have accused the TMC of ""unleashing a reign of terror and destroying democracy"". The TMC, however, has termed the allegations ""baseless"". Aggrieved by the violence that marked Monday's panchayat polls in West Bengal, several candidates in the fray met State Election Commission officials and demanded repolling in their booths. ""I have come here to inform the SEC about yesterday's violence in my locality.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, 29 April, asked youngsters to join the ‘Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2008' launched by his government and announced incentives, including credit point by the UGC, for participants, saying it is an opportunity for those who want to make a change in the society. In his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat' broadcast, Modi also pitched for water conservation, saying it should be everyone's responsibility and asserted that his government has spent Rs 32,000 crore annually outside the MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) budget and 150 lakh acre land have benefitted from it in the last three years. In his over 30-minute address, Modi touched on a number of topics, including Indian athletes', especially women's, achievement in the Commonwealth Games, people's response to his call for fitness and also paid tributes to Prophet Mohammad and Lord Buddha ahead of the month of Ramzan and ‘Buddha Purnima' respectively. Noting that India had carried out nuclear tests on Buddha Purnima on 11 May in 1998, when BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee was prime minister, Modi said youths need to imbibe Vajpayee's mantra of ‘Jai Vigyan' (hail science) to make India modern and strong. It will also boost the cleanliness campaign, a signature project of his government, those who participate in it will feel “a sense of fulfillment” when the country celebrates the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, he said. Turning to water conservation, he said India has traditionally done it and cited examples of many temples and other historic places that have done so and noted that some rivers in states like Kerala and Uttar Pradesh have been revived recently. The programme also shared recorded messages of some of the athletes. He also asked people to think about ways to make the Yoga Day on 21 June memorable. The prime minister drew from the teachings of Prophet Mohammad and said he believed in knowledge and compassion. His life taught people to walk the path of equality and brotherhood, Modi said. India is developing infrastructure to boost Buddhism tourism, he said, and working to connect easily with the Buddhist countries of the south east Asia. Bhim Rao Ambedkar was also inspired by Buddha in his work for empowering the marginalised sections of society, he said. Modi also paid tributes to Rabindranath Tagore, whose birth anniversary falls on 7 May, and said he would regularly listen to ‘Rabindra Sangeet' when he was a child.

" After the Congress, the CPM submitted a notice of no-confidence against the BJP-led central government in the Lok Sabha on Monday.

"As Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal continued his   (L-G), four chief ministers came together for an unprecedented show of Opposition unity, albeit without the Congress. The four chief ministers who expressed support for Kejriwal on Saturday were West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy. Addressing the media, a fiery Mamata Banerjee sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention, saying, ""The mandate of the people must be respected."" She said, ""If this is the condition of Delhi, it sends the wrong message to the rest of the country...We did not take this step immediately, but waited for six days. I had sent a message to Arvind  three days earlier as well."" ""They (members of the Delhi government) say that they are not being allowed to work. We will certainly raise this issue with the prime minister. It is our right to do so,"" Banerjee asserted. The West Bengal chief minister sidestepped the issue of the Congress' absence from the press conference, saying, ""The Congress has its own presence in Delhi. I don't want to comment on this."" The other three chief ministers also addressed the media, but they restricted themselves to making brief statements. Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy too sought the prime minister's intervention, saying, ""We came here to show our support to the Delhi chief minister, and to save the democratic system in the country."" Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said, ""Our demand is very clear. They (Centre) must allow this government to function smoothly. The Centre and the state must work together. The problem has to be sorted out."" Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressed 'solidarity' with the Delhi government, saying, ""All democratic-thinking people are with the Delhi chief minister...The Centre is restricting the federal system which is a threat to the nation."" After the press conference, Kejriwal said: AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha expressed gratitude to the four leaders, saying, ""Sincerely thank West Bengal chief minister, Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Karnataka chief minister and Kerala chief minister for their support. They spent time with (Kejriwal's) family, checked on the health of ministers and then held an extraordinarily powerful press conference."" The BJP reacted to the press conference, saying:  Earlier in the day, Mamata Banerjee attended a meeting at Andhra Bhawan with her counterparts — Vijayan, Kumaraswamy and Naidu. They then visited Kejriwal's residence, where they met his wife and other members of his family. Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel was also present. The four chief ministers also wrote a joint letter to L-G Anil Baijal, seeking to meet Kejriwal who is on a protest at the L-G's office-cum-residence, Raj Niwas. ""All of us would like to make a representation to you with respect to the issues concerning the Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal. Please grant us a meeting slot today (Saturday) as we are waiting. We request you to give us time around 9 pm,"" it read. On the meeting of four chief ministers, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha said: ""This is a teaching for Prime Minister Narendra Modi — no matter how much he tries to kill democracy, our struggle will continue. Kejriwal is getting support from four elected chief ministers."" The four chief ministers met shortly after Baijal declined permission to Banerjee to meet Kejriwal. She had planned to go to the protest site — the Lt Governor's residential office — along with Naidu. Kejriwal, along with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Cabinet ministers Satyendar Jain and Gopal Rai, has been   since Monday demanding a direction to the IAS officers working in the Delhi administration to end their undeclared strike.

" Former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Thursday described the conduct of Wednesday's zila parishad and panchayat samiti polls in the state as ""brutal and broad daylight murder of democracy."" He said ""the wanton lawlessness and criminality"" witnessed on Wednesday during the polls should finally open the eyes of those who thought that the SAD's fears of poll violence were just a ""ruse."" Badal said 19 September, 2018 will be remembered as ""one of the darkest days"" for democracy in Punjab when the Congress made the state ""look like Bihar"" during the latter's worst period. The former chief minister said it was ""extremely painful and regrettable"" that the state election commission completely abdicated its constitutional responsibility on Wednesday. ""Both the state machinery and the state election commission functioned as an extension of the Congress party during the entire poll process,"" he said in a statement in Chandigarh. Badal said not only the mammoth and unprecedented response of Punjabis to the SAD-BJP rally at Faridkot and earlier at Abohar, but also its strong Punjabi and Panthic character had unnerved the Congress and its stooges. ""For these stooges hiding behind Panthic cloaks, yesterday was repayment time for the favours they continue to receive from the Congress government. They carried out poll violence at the behest of the Congress which is keeping them politically afloat for its ultimate anti-Sikh agenda."" ""The Congress is providing political cover to the forces inimical to peace and communal harmony. As in the eighties, this nexus is pushing Punjab into the jaws of violence,"" he said. Badal said the SAD is their prime target because ""our party has always articulated the Sikh and Punjabi cause in a peaceful and democratic way."" ""Peace and democracy is at stake in Punjab. The non-performance of the state government and its betrayal to the people of Punjab on the promises made to them by Amarinder Singh by holding Gutka Sahib (religious book) in hand has completely isolated the Congress from the people,"" he said. The Congress now is using its old card of dividing Punjabis and conspiring to push the brave Sikh community into a fratricidal civil war, he said. Badal said the SAD is determined not only to expose the nexus and its conspiracies but also to save Punjab and the Sikhs from these evil designs. Meanwhile, SAD leaders in Chandigarh alleged the police helped Congress during the polls and sought the registration of a case against SSP Muktsar. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal will not file for anticipatory bail in the ""political vendetta case"" that was registered against him Wednesday, the SAD leaders said. Senior SAD leaders Bikram Singh Majithia, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Dr Daljit Singh Cheema alleged that the officer ""gave directions to the district police to help Congress workers capture booths as per the command of his political masters"".

"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said “extremist forces” were responsible for the failure of a daily five-hour “humanitarian pause” in fighting in the Syrian rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta,   reported. On February 24, Putin had   for a truce around the same time the United Nations Security Council   a resolution for a month-long ceasefire across Syria so people in the conflict-ridden country can receive humanitarian aid.  Putin accused representatives of “terrorist organisations” of preventing civilians from leaving. “The shelling from there never stops, and rocket and mortar attacks occur up to 80 times a day,”   quoted Putin as saying. “We offered to organise a humanitarian corridor to get children, wounded, all those who need help out of the region...If we all join our efforts to stabilise the situation in the country in general and in Eastern Ghouta, we are bound for success,” the Russian leader said at a news conference in Moscow.  The Russian military had accused the rebels of violating the ceasefire hours after the truce went into effect on February 27. “Right now, there is intensive fire from the rebel side and not one civilian has left [the restive region of eastern Ghouta],” Russian General Viktor Pankov had been quoted as saying.

" The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the Bombay high court order refusing extension of time to the state police for filing chargesheet in the Bhima-Koregaon violence case. Recently, the Bombay high court had set aside the lower court’s order allowing an extension of time to police to file its probe report against the rights activists in the violence case. Taking note of the appeal of the Maharashtra government, a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi stayed the high court order and issued a notice to rights activists on the plea. Earlier, the apex court had refused to interfere with the arrest of five rights activists by the Maharashtra Police in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon violence case and declined to appoint a SIT for a probe into their arrest. The Pune Police had arrested lawyer Surendra Gadling, Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen, Dalit activist Sudhir Dhawale, activist Mahesh Raut and Kerala native Rona Wilson in June for their alleged links with Maoists under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The arrests had followed raids at their residences and offices in connection with the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31 last year, which, the police had claimed, had led to violence at Bhima Koregaon the next day.",PTI
" The Yogi Adityanath government on Monday came under fire not just from political rivals like BSP and Congress but also ally SBSP, which claimed building temples would not solve people's problems, as it celebrated its first year in office in Uttar Pradesh. A star-studded event was held in Lucknow with chief minister Adityanath launching a portal to fight corruption and even announcing a massive four lakh appointments to various jobs in as many as 64 departments of the state. ""Through this portal, any officials involved in corruption or who is encouraging it at any level, will not be spared. Effective action will be taken if any video or other evidence is uploaded on the portal. This will deliver a lethal blow against the corrupt elements,"" Adityanath claimed. The state government will come up with four lakh jobs in 64 departments ranging from police constables and sub-inspectors to block development officers and  (revenue officials), he said at the event where Governor Ram Naik and a galaxy of political big-wigs including Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya, Dinesh Sharma and UP BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey were present. ""Today I can say that UP, where there was no law and order and anarchy prevailed, is now witnessing a change,"" Adityanath asserted adding that earlier politics of casteism, divisive forces and dynastic politics ruled the roost. However, sulking ally   put cold water on the mood. already dampened by BJP's recent shock losses in  , by skipping the event. SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, a cabinet minister in the Adityanath government, virtually targeted the ruling dispensation questioning the rationale behind the lavish celebrations. ""We have made this government and it is our duty to repeatedly point out shortcomings. Holding celebrations is not going to serve the purpose. Building temples in Mathura and Kashi will not give education to the poor, or toilets and pension to them,"" a visibly angry Rajbhar told reporters in Lucknow. He also warned the BJP that his party's four MLAs may not vote for the saffron party candidates in the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls in case the senior ally did not shed its ""big brother attitude"". ""If (BJP chief) Amit Shah does not talk to us, our four MLAs will boycott the Rajya Sabha elections (on 23 March),"" Rajbhar asserted. Refusing to take part in the celebrations on completion of one year in office, Rajbhar said, ""Let them celebrate...I will not go to attend it till the questions of ration cards, housing, education, medicine and others are not redressed,"" he said. Stressing that the BJP was ignoring smaller allies, Rajbhar said, ""We kept begging for seats in the local body elections and had to go it alone at the last moment. We were not taken into confidence in the (Lok Sabha) bye-elections. At no place in Purvanchal where senior BJP leaders went, they took the name of SBSP or used our flag."" The SBSP has considerable presence in pockets of Purvanchal in eastern Uttar Pradesh. ""They fielded Anil Agarwal. We are alliance partners but they did not tell us or sought our votes for him. I kept saying let us talk but to no avail. Can an elder brother humiliate the younger one like this,"" he asked. BJP has fielded nine candidates for the Rajya Sabha elections and Agarwal is one of them, though the party is sure of victory in only eight seats. To a question, Rajbhar said he had not talked to either the SP or the BSP. A senior minister in the Adityanath government Suresh Khanna, who met the sulking minister, however, played down the complaints. ""We are members of the government and discuss issues and keep meeting regularly and this meeting is nothing new,"" Khanna stressed. Meanwhile, the Congress alleged that the government was misusing people's money on holding the grand celebrations. In a statement, UP Congress chief Raj Babbar said a cabinet minister was levelling charges of corruption and there was no clarification from the government. He said the BJP was rejected by the people in the recent Lok Sabha bye-elections and yet was celebrating the completion of one year in office. BSP chief Mayawati advised the Uttar Pradesh government to introspect on its failures instead of celebrating. Taking a jibe at Adityanath, the BSP chief said working wholeheartedly for the welfare of 22 crore poor and backward people of the state was the real "" "" and "" "" which his government has failed to do. ""Because of these reasons, the people of the state are expressing their anger against the BJP again and again. There is the possibility of the BJP not performing well in the coming Lok Sabha polls,"" Mayawati said. To a question about an ally venting ire against the BJP government, she said MLAs and ministers of the BJP will also open their mouth ""as there is a difference between what they say and do"".",PTI
"As over 67 percent of the 18.9 lakh voters on Tuesday exercised their franchise in the elections to 60-member Meghalaya Assembly at the end of voting hours, Nagaland witness 75 percent voter turnout as hundreds were still lined up to cast their ballots. The Election Commission said that the final figures of voting in the two states will be out later in the day. Meanwhile, the BJP in Meghalaya filed a complaint with the Election Commission over the alleged broadcast of communal message on radio channel, Radio Mirchi, All India Radio reported. Violence broke out in Nagaland's Akuluto Assembly constituency after two groups from NPF and NDPP clashed, killing one and injuring two others. According to the state CEO, there has been no disturbance to polling process which goes on well, adding that an Additional SP is on the scene. Earlier, Meghalaya CEO Fredrick R Kharkongor has said faulty EVMs and VVPAT errors were reported at some places due to connectivity issue. Several reports of malfunctioning EVMs and VVPATs are constantly emerging from Meghalaya. In Nagaland, reports suggest that voting has been halted in Ladigarh polling station due to tension along Assam-Nagaland Border. Meanwhile, the first polling percentages have been released for both the states. A bomb explosion has been reported at a polling booth in Tizit Assembly constituency in Nagaland. The bomb explosion occurred at 6.45 am and one man has suffered injuries in his left leg, says Nagaland Police. State's chief minister TR Zeliang has sought peaceful resolution of the five-decade long insurgency after successful elections. Even as polling is underway in Meghalaya and Nagaland, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to urge voters to 'come out in large numbers' to vote. The stage is set for Tuesday's crucial Assembly elections in the two northeastern states of Meghalaya and Nagaland. Polling will be held between 7 am and 4 pm, except in some polling stations of the interior districts of Nagaland, where the process is scheduled to conclude at 3 pm. The two states have a 60-member House each, but voting will be held for 59 constituencies in both. In Meghalaya, the election has been countermanded in Williamnagar in the wake of the killing of NCP candidate Jonathone N Sangma in an IED blast in East Garo Hills district on 18 February. In Nagaland, NDPP chief Neiphiu Rio has been declared elected unopposed from the Northern Angami-II constituency. The results of the polls in the two states, along with that of Tripura, will be declared on 3 March. A high-decibel campaign for the polls in the two states came to an end on Sunday evening. Buoyed by the formation of governments in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, the BJP is making a determined bid to expand its footprint in the North East. For the Congress, the poll outcome in Meghalaya is particularly significant as it has been ruling the state for the last 10 years. But this time, the BJP is leaving no stone unturned to throw the Congress out of power and add Meghalaya into its kitty. Political observers are keenly watching the BJP's push in the North East, a Congress stronghold, where the saffron party has traditionally been a marginal player. In Meghalaya, the Congress and the BJP are pitted against each other. While the former has fielded 59 candidates, the latter has put up nominees in 47 constituencies. Though they are contesting the polls separately, in Meghalaya, the National People's Party (NPP) of Conrad Sangma, son of former Lok Sabha speaker P A Sangma, is the BJP's partner in the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA). In Nagaland, BJP's hope hinges on its alliance partner NDPP (the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party) of Neiphiu Rio, which is contesting from 40 seats. The saffron party has fielded candidates from the remaining 20 seats. The Congress, which has given three chief ministers to Nagaland since the state's inception in 1963, is contesting from only 18 seats, two less than the BJP, an emerging entity in the North East. There are 370 candidates in the fray in Meghalaya. A total of 18.4 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in 3,083 polling stations in the state. Meghalaya's Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) FR Kharkongor said for the first time, 67 all-women polling stations and 61 model polling stations were set up in the state. He added that 32 women candidates were in the fray, the highest ever in the state. In Nagaland, a total of 11,91,513 voters -- 6,01,707 (50.50 percent) men and 5,89,806 (49.50 percent) women -- will exercise their franchise on Tuesday. There are also 5,925 service voters. 
Voting will be conducted in 2,156 polling stations as 40 polling stations fall under the Northern Angami-II seat, from where Rio has been declared elected unopposed. Over 15,000 government employees will be on poll duty and there will be 177 all-women polling stations across 25 constituencies in the state. The election process in Nagaland had started on a difficult note. Following a no-election diktat from the Core Committee of Nagaland Tribal Hohos and Civil Organisations (CCNTHCO), advocating ""solution (to the Naga political issue) before election"", the political parties had initially kept away from the poll process. Though the process of nomination-filing had started on 31 January, the first batch of 22 contestants filed their candidature only on the penultimate day on 5 February. There was a heavy rush of nominees filing their papers on the last day. After the scrutiny and withdrawal, a total of 227 nominees are left in the field in Nagaland. As many as 281 companies of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), beside the state police force, are deployed throughout Nagaland to ensure a peaceful election. Nagaland's CEO Abhijit Sinha said all the polling stations would be manned by the CAPF personnel, while the state police would also be assisting them. Of the 2,156 polling stations in Nagaland, 1,100 were declared critical, 530 vulnerable and 526 normal, he added. The Meghalaya CEO told  that six of the 10 additional companies of CAPF were deployed in the troubled East and South Garo Hills districts.",FP Staff
"Two days after a militant attack on the Sunjwan Army Camp in Jammu and Kashmir, the state’s Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, while speaking at the assembly, urged for a dialogue between India and Pakistan on the growing terrorism. The Jammu and Kashmir assembly also observed silence as a mark of tribute to the Army soldiers killed in the terrorist attack at Sunjuwan army camp. Speaking on the attack, Mufti acknowledged that any attempt for a dialogue on her side would be called out as ‘anti-national’ by certain media houses. Mufti then went on to state that although India had fought and won wars against Pakistan, this had come at the cost of the lives of jawans and civilians, and these deaths could be stopped through dialogue. She also questioned as to how the said media houses would have reacted if erstwhile Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee were to have initiated dialogue with Pakistan. Former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah too, urged for the central government to take a tough stand against terrorism that had the hit the state. Abdullah warned Pakistan against the state of terrorism by saying that it would create increasing troubles for them, to the extent that nothing would be left. Militants attacked the Sunjwan army camp near Jammu in the wee hours of Saturday, 10 February. Six persons, including five army men and the father of a jawan, died while ten others were injured in the attack. At least three militants were also gunned down. On Monday, 12 February, security forces foiled an attempted attack at a CRPF camp in Srinagar’s Karan Nagar. Local reports suggest that one CRPF jawan was killed in the gunfire exchange that ensued.

"As the NDA in Bihar faces the ticklish question of seat-sharing for 2019 Lok Sabha elections, major constituents JD(U) and BJP have started building their case for a bigger portion of the 40 seats from the state. The JD(U) has insisted that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is the leader of the alliance and it has been the ""senior partner"" in the state, indicating that it should get a major share. Reacting to it, the BJP said on Monday, 4 June, that while it agreed Kumar was the face of the NDA in Bihar, the Lok Sabha elections will be fought under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, thus staking claim to a major share in the seats. While the JD(U) had gone out all alone in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll and won just two seats, it registered an impressive presence in the Assembly elections held a year later as a partner of the RJD and the Congress in the Grand Alliance ( ). In 2009 Lok Sabha polls, when the two fought together, the JD(U) had won 22 out of 25 seats it had contested while the BJP won 12 out of 15. Echoing the line taken by party leaders KC Tyagi and Pawan Varma after a high-level party meeting on Sunday, JD(U) spokesperson Ajay Alok told reporters: Alok was responding to queries over reports in a section of the media that it was resolved at a meeting of the party's core committee on Sunday that “JD(U) will play the role of big brother in Bihar just like the BJP does in Delhi”. Varma had said “Nitish Kumar is the face of the NDA in Bihar. That is why he is the chief minister”. To a query whether the JD(U), which had only two members in the Lok Sabha, was likely to press for a seat-sharing arrangement commensurate with its relatively higher strength in the state Assembly, Alok said: He, however, added, “Under different circumstances, it would require all NDA constituents to sit together and thrash out a seat-sharing arrangement that is acceptable to all”. After Kumar snapped ties with the BJP in 2013, smaller parties like Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, headed by Kumar's associate-turned-critic Upendra Kushwaha, joined the NDA which went on to win a total of 31 seats in the state in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, out of which the BJP bagged 22. While Kushwaha has demanded that seat-sharing be decided at the earliest, Paswan is also understood to have taken up the matter with BJP president Amit Shah when he called on him in Delhi last week. Meanwhile, BJP leaders sought to play down the JD(U)'s stance. BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who was in Delhi to attend a meeting of state environment ministers, said: Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who has been known to be a bitter critic of Kumar, also struck a conciliatory note, saying, “He is the chief minister of the state and Narendra Modi is the prime minister of the country. Why are some people trying to make a controversy out of that?” However, the party's state vice-president Mithilesh Tiwari said, “It is beyond doubt that the Lok Sabha polls will be fought under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”. Replying to a query, he said, “If the JD(U) is trying to put pressure, through the media, for a favourable seat-sharing arrangement, then it should not do so.” Union Minister Ram Kripal Yadav, a former close aide of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad who had joined the BJP in 2014, also said, “I cannot comment on seat-sharing but Lok Sabha polls will be fought under the leadership of Narendra Modi.” The NDA in Bihar is scheduled to hold a meeting in Patna, the first since the chief minister rejoined the coalition, on Thursday, 7 June.

The joint secretary post is usually filled through exams conducted by the Union Public Service Commission. An advertisement published in leading newspapers on Sunday mentioned the government was looking for 10 “outstanding individuals”, even from the private sector, with expertise in the areas of revenue, financial services, economic affairs, agriculture, cooperation and farmers’ welfare, road transport and highway, shipping, environment, forests and climate change, new and renewable energy, civil aviation and commerce. The diplomatic world was left gobsmacked this weekend after US President Donald Trump caused havoc at the annual G7 summit in Canada before jetting off halfway across the world to Singapore to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with nothing more than a “getting-to-know each-other” agenda for now. In scenes, remarks, and tweets that are unprecedented in the staid and circumspect diplomatic world, Trump brought the US-led alliance of advanced economies close to a rupture, refusing to sign a joint communique with the group and insulting his host by calling him a “dishonest liar” — all over the contentious issue of trade tariffs on which he feels the US has been stiffed. Even India was drawn into the fracas, with Trump insisting his gripe on tariffs was not restricted to the advanced economies alone. At least one senior Karnataka office-bearer of the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, an affiliate of the Sanatan Sanstha, knew about the existence of an “extremist unit” in the parent organisation, according to a probe by a Special Investigation Team of Karnataka Police in the killing of journalist Gauri Lankesh. Investigations have found that a Bengaluru-based co-ordinator of HJS, Mohan Gowda, allegedly put key accused, KT Naveen Kumar, in touch with this Sanstha unit in the planning phase of the Lankesh murder. Gowda allegedly connected Naveen Kumar last year to Sujeet Kumar alias Praveen, a 37-year-old Udupi resident, who was part of this unit and was arrested on 31 May. In a clarion call, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday, 10 June, exhorted party workers with the slogan 'L-G, Delhi Chodo' (L-G, Quit Delhi), as the ruling Aam Aadmi Party announced a city-wide campaign for full statehood to Delhi. Addressing party's ward-level officer-bearers and legislators at his residence in New Delhi, the chief minister equalled the fight for Delhi's full statehood with the freedom struggle. In a passionate address, he said Mahatma Gandhi had launched Quit India campaign during the British rule, and the Aam Aadmi Party will run 'L-G, Delhi Chodo' campaign. During the last one year, Delhi government’s excise department has found nine prominent restobars in popular hangout zones, such as Hauz Khas, New Friends Colony and Connaught Place, serving “expired beer.” This revelation came when AAP MLA Vishesh Ravi sought to know in the Assembly about the violations found in the bars and restaurants. In a written response to the MLA’s question, the Excise Department said its enforcement branch had conducted an inspection at 214 pubs, bars and restaurants during the past year and found that 94 out of 214 restobars were violating various excise rules.

"In politically significant remarks, the ruling AIADMK on 22 April said that signs of its working together with BJP like a ""double-barrelled gun"" in the political arena were visible and ""no one can sever ties"" between the two parties. Coming out strongly against the principal opposition DMK-led persistent protests over the Cauvery imbroglio, the AIADMK said: No one can weaken the bond between ""the Central and the State governments"" either, the AIADMK said in its Tamil mouthpiece  The state's ruling party said the protests by the DMK, its allies and friendly parties on the Cauvery issue were only aimed at spoiling the warmth between it and the BJP. However, the AIADMK mouthpiece said, ""A roadmap for it should be thrashed out by the high commands of both the parties. That is the need of the hour."" ""The state and the Central regimes led by the AIADMK and the BJP respectively are working responsibly and are headed towards a final resolution of the issue,"" the daily added, referring to the Cauvery issue. Under such circumstances, the AIADMK said, the main opposition DMK was holding ""unnecessary protests"" as it was ""apprehensive"" that the State and the Central governments, working in cohesion, would succeed in resolving the Cauvery issue. Mocking the DMK for holding protests which did not enjoy the ""people's support,"" the AIADMK hit out at its arch rival for trying to get an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi now on the issue after attempting to show black flags to him recently. Asking if it was an act of ""political civility,"" the AIADMK mouthpiece said no other party could indulge in such politics burying its self-respect. The AIADMK said its government allowed protests like black flag demonstrations keeping democratic ethos in mind. The daily, however, asked if the protesters succeeded in showing even a single black flag to Prime Minister Modi. It may be recalled that the AIADMK top leadership has been maintaining that a friendly relationship with the Centre was imperative for the progress of the state through proper financial sanctions and support. The DMK, however, has been unrelenting in its attack saying the ruling party was ""subservient,"" to the Centre. If this was not done, ""it will lead to cracks in the unity and integration"" (of the nation), it had cautioned. The AIADMK's assertion assumes significance amid the persistent protests on the Cauvery issue. The DMK-led Opposition and the pro-Tamil outfits have been holding back-to-back protests including the recent anti-IPL stir on the river water issue and a massive human chain demonstration (by DMK and its allies) has been announced across the state tomorrow.

As per convention, the monsoon and Budget sessions of the state legislature are held in Mumbai while Nagpur, the second capital of Maharashtra, hosts the winter session in December. Shiv Sena minister Eknath Shinde recalled the July 2005 Mumbai deluge to oppose the idea of holding the monsoon session in Nagpur.

"Civil liberties activist Gautam Navlakha, arrested in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon case and his alleged links with Maoists, has moved the Bombay high court seeking to quash the case lodged against him by Pune Police. In his petition filed earlier this month, Navlakha urged the high court to quash the First Information Report (FIR) lodged against him, claiming there was no evidence against him and that he was being falsely implicated. His petition will be heard on Friday by the high court’s division bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharti Dangre. Navlakha, prominent Telugu poet Varavara Rao, activists Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves and trade union activist Sudha Bharadwaj were arrested in August this year by the Pune police. However, the Supreme Court had later ordered for the activists to be kept in house arrest. The apex court had last month refused to interfere in the case and said the Pune Police could go ahead with its probe. Earlier this month, the Delhi high court had allowed Navlakha to be freed from the house arrest. It granted him the relief, saying the Supreme Court had earlier given him the liberty to approach the appropriate forum within four weeks to seek further recourse. The Pune police had claimed earlier that that they seized documents and communication exchanged between the accused persons which allegedly revealed their links with Maoist leaders and their role in facilitating weapons and funding. The five activists were arrested on August 28 in connection with an FIR lodged following a conclave – ‘Elgaar Parishad’ – held on December 31 last year that had allegedly triggered violence later at the Koregaon-Bhima village in Pune. They were put under house arrest on August 29 following an apex court order on the plea by historian Romila Thapar, economists Prabhat Patnaik and Devaki Jain, sociology professor Satish Deshpande and human rights lawyer Maja Daruwala against the police action.

"The Supreme Court today approved the Centre’s draft Cauvery Management Scheme for smooth distribution of water among four southern riparian states. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra rejected the suggestions of Karnataka and Kerala governments over the scheme, terming them as devoid of merits. The bench, also comprising justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, said the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal’s award, which was modified by the apex court, has to be taken to the logical conclusion by the Cauvery Management Scheme. It also dismissed Tamil Nadu’s plea seeking initiation of contempt against the Centre for non-finalisation of Cauvery scheme. Karnataka, which is facing political tug of war between BJP and Congress-JD (S) over government formation, had earlier made a failed bid to temporarily stall the finalisation of draft Cauvery management scheme. The top court had made it clear that it would see that the draft scheme is “in consonance with its judgement only.” Earlier, the bench had red-flagged the provision empowering the Centre to issue the directions, saying “this part (power of Centre to issue directions) of the scheme is not in consonance with the judgement. We make it clear to you”. The observation was made after the Centre had submitted the draft Cauvery Management Scheme in the court for its approval. The apex court, in its verdict delivered on February 16, had asked the Centre to frame the Cauvery Management Scheme, including creation of the Cauvery Managament Board, for release of water from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. The scheme, once finalised, would deal with the issue of water share of the four states in different circumstances like normal and deficient water years in the Cauvery river basin. The top court had modified the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal award of 2007 and made it clear that it will not be extending time for this on any ground. It had raised the 270 tmcft share of Cauvery water for Karnataka by 14.75 tmcft and reduced Tamil Nadu’s share, while compensating it by allowing extraction of 10 tmcft groundwater from the river basin, saying the issue of drinking water has to be placed on a “higher pedestal”.",PTI
"Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday, 14 September, called English a ‘disease’ that the British had left behind. Speaking at a ‘Hindi Diwas’ programme at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi, he said that Hindi is the “symbol of social, political, religious, and linguistic unity of the country.” He added that Hindi was the main communication language among the freedom fighters of the country and it was spoken and understood by most of the people. Naidu said it was not a matter of debate whether Hindi was the best among all Indian languages as there were many other languages which were older and more vibrant than Hindi. ""Sanskrit is the mother of all languages and there are many regional languages which are very vibrant,"" he said. He also opined that language plays an important role in the implementation of government welfare schemes in a country and the schemes will be successful only when people get the benefits. For this, it is important that the government works are done in people's language, he said. ""If we desire that our democracy continues to be progressive and becomes stronger, then we will have to use Hindi in the functioning of the Union government and the regional languages in the functioning of the state governments.

"The Punjab and Haryana high Court has restrained the Haryana government from withdrawing the cases registered in connection with the Jat agitation in 2016.

" In remarks that could stir up a row, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday used the #MeToo movement analogy to take potshots at Congress and warn parties wishing to ally with it for elections that they should not repent later and be compelled to run a similar campaign.

"Amid Congress' stinging allegations that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ""anti-Dalit"", Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath on Sunday, 24 June, without naming the grand old party said when would those claiming Dalits were being humiliated ask for reservation in Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia. According to a   by NDTV, the chief minister was speaking at a public meeting in Kannauj where he further asked: ""If the BHU can give it (reservation) to Dalits and backwards then why not in Aligarh Muslim University?"" Reacting to the chief minister's remark, Professor Shafey Kidwai, member-in-charge PRO AMU, said the university’s admission policy falls under the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction. ""The matter is pending in the apex court,"" he said adding, ""currently, we don't have any reservation on the basis of religion"". ""There is 50% reservation for internal students,"" he said, adding that the university will follow court's decision. Adityanath's comment comes close on the heels of a controversy that battered the Aligarh Muslim University last month. The institute had witnessed violent protests over a portrait of Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah which has been hanging at the University Student Union Hall for years now. The demand for the removal of Jinnah’s portrait had led to the disturbance which also coincided with former Vice-President Hamid Ansari's visit to the university. Adityanath, however, is not the first BJP leader to have demanded the restoration of SC/ST quota in Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia. In April 2018, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot had said that the Modi-led government was attempting the same in the two minority institutes.

" Prime Minister Narendra Modi slammed the Congress on Sunday for dragging his parents into a political slugfest, alleging that it was being done at the behest of party chief Rahul Gandhi.

Congress leaders have kicked up a controversy recently by first comparing the falling value of the rupee   and then claiming that the father of the prime minister was  .

(referring to Rahul Gandhi) is tacitly supporting it, and therefore, its leaders are dragging the name of my father, who passed away 30 years ago,"" Modi said, addressing a rally in Vidisha in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh. ""The Congress is running out of steam in this election, so they have started dragging my parents into politics. No Congressman would make such a statement against me or my family without the consent of the party president (Rahul Gandhi). It is the ' ' (dynast) who is making his leaders speak against me,"" he added. ""My mother sits in her house, performing religious rites, confining herself to a room, and has never visited Madhya Pradesh. She does not even know the 'R' of ' ' (politics),"" Modi said. ""Yesterday, they took the name of my mother and now my father. The Congress chief is behind this...   alleges that the prime minister takes the names of his family members. Yes, I have to take their names as they were in politics, unlike my family members who sit quietly in their home and do their job,"" he added. ""Had my parents held any public post, they should also have been criticised."" ""Your family has occupied top positions at the national level. The more you ask me about my performance, the onus is more on your family as well,"" he added. The Opposition party was left with no issues and was, therefore, indulging in this kind of an abusive rhetoric, Modi said. ""The Congress should compare its 55 years of rule with my four years (at the Centre) and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's 15 years (in the state). ""The Congress is lying so much to people that the people of Madhya Pradesh should wake up and ensure that not a single Congress candidate wins,"" he added.

" AAP's Haryana unit chief Naveen Jaihind Tuesday provoked a controversy over the alleged gangrape of a girl in the state, saying he will give Rs 20 lakh to any BJP leader who gets sexually assaulted by 10 people. Jaihind, the husband of Delhi Commission for Women chairperson Swati Maliwal, made the remarks while condemning the BJP government in Haryana for giving only Rs 2 lakh as compensation to the Rewari gang rape victim.

We have to keep those norms in mind.” Stating that Lord Ram symbolised ""maryada"" (dignity) and the seers were his representatives in the society, he said all problems needed to be resolved while staying within the ambit of that dignity.

In an interview with  , Khurshid said the United Progressive Alliance went into the elections demoralised, and already accepting defeat. “There was no platform where ministers could take a uniform position on controversial issues, and Manmohan Singh’s government gave the impression of being a lameduck government since 2012,” he said.

We had no way of knowing how to handle him,” Khurshid said. “Kejriwal would speak to Mukherjee in a very submissive voice and go out say something completely different. Mukherjee once called me at 11 pm and told me ‘Salman call the press and inform.’ And for the first time, I was calling the press at midnight to say that Kejriwal has said something rubbish.” Khurshid claimed that the Congress did not have much camaraderie with former Telecom Minister A Raja, one of the prime accused in the 2G scam. “We did not have much equation with Raja and the likes,” he said. “It was not the kind of camaraderie where we would immediately go and say we will handhold for you.

" Seeking to reach out to Dalits, Congress president Rahul Gandhi will on 23 April launch his party's nationwide ‘save the constitution' campaign, aimed at highlighting alleged attacks on the Constitution and the community. The Congress' present and former Dalit lawmakers, those holding offices in zila parishad, civic bodies and panchayat samitis, will take part in the launch event, aimed at sensitising the attendees on the current state of affairs with regard to the community. Besides, the Congress' office-bearers attached to its regional units, its youth, women and Seva Dal wings will also attend the event, to be held here at the Talkatora stadium. The attendees are expected to take the message forward, holding similar campaigns in states to reach out to community members, the Congress' scheduled caste department chairman and event organiser Nitin Raut told  . “The Constitution is under attack under the BJP's rule. The community is being denied educational, employment opportunities. There is anger among its members on various issues. The meeting will highlight that. “Our leaders will take message from the convention in their respective areas,” Raut added. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reported remarks that he could be elevated to the coveted post because of the Dalit icon B R Ambedkar, Raut asked why then the Constitution and Dalits were allegedly under attack under his dispensation. Raut further claimed that such a situation did not prevail when the Congress was in power. “The Congress has delivered for the community. Those attending the convention will highlight that too in their areas,” he added. Dalits form roughly 17 percent of the country's electorate. There are 84 Parliamentary seats reserved for candidates belonging to the scheduled castes. The BJP had bagged nearly half of the seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, reflecting in its success in politically key states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Raut said only three-four seats were won by the Congress then. The party now aims to win as many seats as possible in the next general election, he added. Efforts are also on to galvanise the Dalit community's support to Gandhi nationally, the party sources said.",PTI

"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Saturday termed ""frivolous"" the criminal defamation complaint filed by the BJP against him in a Delhi court and alleged that it was an attempt to ""throttle the freedom of expression"". Delhi BJP leader Rajeev Babbar had earlier filed a complaint against Tharoor’s alleged “scorpion” remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said his religious sentiments were hurt by the statement. The complaint, filed through advocate Neeraj, termed the statement an ""intolerable abuse"" and ""absolute vilification"" of the faith of millions of people. According to  , Tharoor was at the event owing to his recently released book – ‘The Paradoxical Prime Minister’ – and had said that the Prime Minister’s “personality cult” did not go down well with a lot of insiders in the RSS. Reacting to the defamation suit, Tharoor told reporters, ""The charges are frivolous ... If we start to stifle the right of the people to quote published material then where would our democracy head? Where is the freedom of expression?"" Tharoor said he had quoted an article published in a magazine in 2012 in which a comment of an unnamed RSS leader had been mentioned. ""So why has this defamation suit been filed against me now? In my book, I as a writer had quoted 5,000 other examples and stories,"" he said. Tharoor said he did not believe that he had done anything wrong or out of the ordinary and any author would have felt free to quote such published material in writing. ""I have also quoted Mr Modi's authorised biography by Andy Marino quite extensively. So it is not as if the 500-page book can be reduced to one line which this particular complainant doesn't like,"" Tharoor, also a writer and former diplomat, said. ""I am surprised to hear about the defamation suit. I hope the judge will throw it out on the grounds that this is the actual fact. But if not then certainly we have to defend it,"" Tharoor asserted. The complaint was filed under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code relating to defamation. The matter is likely to come up for hearing next Saturday, 10 November. Needless to say, Tharoor has the drawn the ire of the BJP, who have demanded an explanation from Congress President Rahul Gandhi.

"After embracing   ahead of Assembly polls, Congress has now played up to the majority sentiment in Rajasthan by wading into the Ayodhya controversy. Playing a BJP, Congress leader CP Joshi claimed that if any government can deliver on the promise of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya, it is under a Congress prime minister. The Congress party usually gives a guarded response when directly confronted with the Ram mandir issue. The party, in recent times, have stated that it will   on the issue. However, with elections just around the corner, Joshi decided to throw caution out of the window and said that the if anyone, only a Congress prime minister will have the will to build the temple.

Only a Congress prime minister can get the temple built."" Joshi, who is contesting the Assembly polls this time from Nathdwara, even flayed the BJP for picking up the issue only in poll season to derive electoral gains. He, however, said that the BJP can't do anything this time in Rajasthan as it is facing massive anti-incumbency. It was indeed Rajiv  the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Bir Bahadur Singh to open the lock in 1986 and allowed religious rites to take place inside the disputed structure. This triggered a mass movement by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) which launched an agitation to break free the idols of Lord Rama and Sita from ""captivity"". “Sacred stones” were carried from all over the country to lay the foundation of the temple, and in light of this, massive riots occurred all across north India, particularly Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

" The ruling BJP created a ruckus on Thursday in the Maharashtra Assembly demanding the suspension of Leader of Opposition in the Council Dhananjay Munde over a controversial audio clip that allegedly featured his name. A Marathi news channel on Wednesday allegedly aired an audio clip in which it was purportedly claimed that Munde, a senior NCP leader, had stalled a Calling Attention Motion in the Legislative Council in lieu of bribe. Munde rubbished the accusations against him and alleged it was a tactic adopted by the government to divert people's attention from ""core issues"" plaguing the state. The BJP MLAs vociferously raised the issue in the Assembly and demanded the suspension of Munde from the Upper House. However, the BJP's stand was not supported by any other party, including its ally the Shiv Sena. Instead, the Shiv Sena MLAs pressed for continuing with the suspension of Prashant Paricharak, an independent MLC supporting the BJP, over his remarks last year. BJP MLA Anil Gote led the BJP charge against Munde. ""The audio clip ran by the news channel, which has been widely circulated on social media, has a conservation of some individuals talking about managing a calling attention question and asking money for it. ""They have allegedly mentioned the names of Munde and other NCP leaders along with a senior administrative officer of Vidhan Bhavan. ""This is serious, and Munde should be suspended from the Upper House followed by an inquiry against him,"" Gote said. NCP MLAs such as Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and those from the Congress took objection to the BJP taking the name of Munde, a member of the Council, in the Assembly without official permission. There is no technical ground for demanding the suspension of Munde in the Lower House, said Pawar, a former minister. Along with Gote, several other BJP members rushed to the well of the House and shouted slogans against Munde. Amid the din, Speaker Haribhau Bagade adjourned the House two times. Pawar, speaking to reporters outside the Assembly, said the BJP is playing ""low level"" politics and taking the conversation between two individuals on its face value. The audio clip and claims made in it have not been verified, but still the BJP is demanding Munde's suspension, Pawar said. ""We never expected the BJP to stoop so low. It shows the BJP is least concerned about people's issues,"" Pawar said. As the House reassembled around noon, Gote, while continuing his attack on Munde, made a reference to the suspension of Paricharak. Paricharak's suspension from the Upper House was revoked on Wednesday, a move opposed by the Shiv Sena. A former NCP leader, Paricharak had won the Council election from Solapur in 2015 as an independent and later extended support to the BJP. He was suspended a year ago for allegedly making derogatory remarks about wives of army soldiers. Sunil Prabhu, a Sena MLA, interrupted Gote and rushed towards the Speaker's podium along with other party MLAs demanding that Paricharak's suspension be continued.",PTI

" The Narendra Modi government has carried out more developmental works in its four years than Opposition parties during their 48-year rule, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi claimed on Tuesday. He exuded confidence that the NDA would win an absolute majority in the 2019 general elections on the back of the works it carried out. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to inclusive growth had ensured the welfare of the poor, the youth, farmers, minorities and women, a BJP statement quoted the minority affairs minister as saying. The minister claimed that ""there is an atmosphere of trust"" and development among all sections of society including minorities due to the government's policy of empowerment without appeasement. He made the comments while inaugurating a number of projects under the Centre's multi-sectoral development programme (MsDP). Developmental works carried out by the Modi government in the last 48 months for socio-economic-educational empowerment of the needy, including minorities, did not take place even in the 48-year rule of the Congress and its allies, the statement read.

Uttar Pradesh would soon become one of the most developed states of the country, he said.

Telangana Congress in-charge Ramachandra Khuntia alleged that Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief K Chandrasekhar Rao had dissolved the Legislative Assembly before the completion of its term to get minority votes. Then Rao can join hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA in the Lok Sabha polls, he added. ""The Congress is ready to contest and win the Telangana Assembly elections,"" Khuntia said. He added that the party will hold talks for a tie-up with the Telangana Jan Samiti, CPI and other smaller parties in the state. ""A (pre-poll) arrangement with the AIMIM is out of question,"" he said. Speaking about the TRS releasing its list of candidates for the elections, Khunti said: ""The TRS is a party of one person and family. The Congress is a national party and candidates are decided after deliberations at all levels of the organisation. The names of (Congress) candidates will be announced at the right time."" Khunti said only Congress president Rahul Gandhi could announce the name of the party's chief ministerial candidate. ""Rahul Gandhi has the right to announce the party's chief ministerial candidate. But the party normally does not do it,"" he said. ""The elections will be fought under the leadership of state Congress chief Uttam (Kumar) Reddy. He will decide on the chief ministerial candidate after the elections based on the opinion of the MLAs,"" Khunti added. He claimed that Muslims, Dalits and other weaker sections of society have no faith in Owaisi or KCR, as Rao is popularly known, because the two leaders are focused only on the prosperity of their families. The Congress in-charge also accused Rao of not fulfilling his promises. ""Reservation was not granted to minorities in Telangana. The poor did not get houses. The area of influence of the land and sand mafias has grown. They (KCR's government) have made the state 'Telangana of KCR family.'""",Press Trust of India
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, 6 April, interacted with Bharatiya Janata Party workers of five Lok Sabha seats and the presidents of the party’s 734 district units though his NaMo App, to mark the party’s 38th foundation day. Stating that the BJP followed democratic ideals while shunning “dynastic and caste-based politics,” Modi encouraged the party workers to work for the people in tandem with the government. The BJP celebrated its 38th foundation day, marking the day with a mega event in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex. Addressing a press conference in Mumbai, party president Amit Shah said that the party was not aiming to bring in a “Congress-mukt Bharat,” but a “Congress culture-mukt Bharat.” Addressing concerns about the BJP’s rocky relationship with the Shiv Sena, the BJP president said the party wished to stay with its local alliance partner. He also criticised the Opposition for launching a joint effort to take down the BJP government in the upcoming 2019 general elections. “I have heard that whenever floods happen, all the animals come together. Similarly, all these animals like snakes, dogs, cats and mongoose are coming together to fight the Modi flood,” he said. Earlier in the day, Shah had also blamed the Opposition for the Budget Session washout. “Ghulam Nabi Azad, you fix the stage and we'll be up for debate. We have nothing to hide,"" the BJP president had reportedly said.

It marks a radical change in the political stand of Swami Namdev Tyagi, popularly known as Computer Baba, who had been anointed as a minister of state by the BJP government. Computer Baba had organised 'Narmade Sansad', a gathering of like-minded religious leaders from various states including Uttar Pradesh, in Jabalpur on Friday to decide which party they should support in the polls. ""The saints will support the Congress,"" he said at the gathering. ""When we can give fifteen years to them (the Bharatiya Janata Party), then we can surely give five years to Congress,"" he said. ""If Congress upholds dharma, we will go with them in future or else we will withdraw the support,"" he said.

" The BSP on Wednesday demanded disqualification of its former leader Nasimuddin Siddiqui from the membership of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council. In a letter to the Legislative Council, Chairman Ramesh Yadav, Leader of the BSP Legislature Party in the Upper House Sunil Kumar Chittor informed that Siddiqui had joined another party on 18 Feburary after resigning from Mayawati's party on his own. Hence, it amounted to violation of the anti-defection law, BSP national general secretary SC Misra said, quoting Chittor's letter to the Council chairman. Siddiqui had become a BSP MLC on 23 January, 2015 and quit the party to join the Congress on 18 February. In November 2017, Council Chairman Ramesh Yadav had rejected the Bahujan Samaj Party's petition to disqualify Siddiqui as a member of the legislative council on the ground that he had left the party. In an application to the council chairman on 29 June, the party had demanded that Siddiqui should not be given any facility or allowance that he used to enjoy as a legislator. At that time too, Chittor had sent the application to the chairman citing various rules, seeking that Siddiqui be disqualified from membership with effect from 27 May. It was on 27 May that Siddiqui floated a new outfit, the Rashtriya Bahujan Morcha, after he was expelled from the BSP. The BSP in its petition had said that Siddiqui was elected on a BSP ticket and since he was no longer associated with the party, he should be disqualified from the membership of the council.

"Prime Minister Modi is no stranger to historical bloopers. On 29 June, history was once again a casualty, with the PM telling a rally at Uttar Pradesh’s Maghar district: “It is said that here, Saint Kabir, Guru Nankadeva and Baba Gorakhnath sat together and discussed spirituality”. The PM made the comments while paying obeisance to the mystic poet Kabir on his death anniversary. The three historic figures lived in different eras. While Baba Gorakhnath is believed to have been born between the 11th and 12th century, poet Kabir was born at the end of the 14th century. Guru Nanak, on the other hand, lived between the 15th century and the 16th century. Reports of Baba Gorakhnath meeting either Sant Kabir or Guru Nanak could hardly be a possibility. However, as this India Today report points out, Kabir and Guru Nanak may have met in Madhya Pradesh’s pilgrim town of Amarkantak. In Uttar Pradesh, Prime Minister Modi also launched the BJP’s campaign for the 2019 polls. “Lust for power has brought even the rivals together and those who opposed Emergency are now hand in glove with Congress,”   quoted him as saying. Senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwary schooled PM Modi on getting his facts wrong, PTI reported. ""The prime minister should enlighten us as to how that could be possible. Gorakhnath was born in the 11th century, at lease four centuries before the birth of Sant Kabir. Guru Nanak was younger than Kabir by a few decades... And their meeting is neither a historical fact nor a generally held belief,"" the senior RJD leader told PTI. ""Given his stature now, he (Modi) should realise that such goof-ups on his part are an embarrassment to the entire country. If he feels such a strong urge to delve into history during his speeches, he should at least get the facts checked,"" the RJD leader said. in 2013, as India Today points out, Modi at a rally in Patna talked about the “power of Bihar” and cited emperor Ashok, Pataliputra along with Takshila. However, Takshila was located in present-day Pakistan (then Punjab) and not Bihar. During poll campaigning in Karnataka, PM Modi on 3 May, claimed that the Congress government under the prime ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru had humiliated two of the military icons hailing from the state — Field Marshal Cariappa and General Thimayya.

Claming that the government has ""failed"" on the foreign policy front, Tharoor in an interview to PTI said the Congress would highlight these ""failures"" as also the so called schemes that have remained ""empty slogans"" with no effect on the ground ""The simple question to the voters is: Are you better off than you were in 2014? Have ' ' come for you? Most will say no,"" he asserted.

Asked what had brought about the change in Gandhi's image from a “reluctant politician” to a “real challenger”, he said it was the Congress chief's own efforts. “Rahul Gandhi has been especially sharp and incisive in his statements, while at the same time attentive and involved with the concerns of the country. His enthusiasm on social media, his wit, energy and sense of humour are all on display,” the former Union minister said. “This is a man whose engagement on social media platforms speaks to a wider engagement with politics. There is neither ‘reluctance' nor frivolity on display here, only commitment and passion to make a better India,” he said. Tharoor, whose ‘Hindu Pakistan' and ‘Taliban in Hinduism' remarks had created a furore recently, said he does not regret the comments. He asserted that the challenge in saying anything was how quickly the BJP and the media take it out of context to whip up a controversy. ""I did not say India is a Hindu Pakistan. I said if the BJP wins again and has the strength in both Houses of Parliament and the states, there will be nothing restraining them from fulfilling their project of creating a Hindu Rashtra, which would be a mirror image of Pakistan (since it too would be state for a religious majority) and so reduce us to a Hindu Pakistan,"" he clarified.

After the attack, Tharoor at a public rally in Thiruvananthapuram had said, ""Who gave them the right to decide I can't live here and must go to Pakistan? Are they saying that because I am not their kind of Hindu, I have no right to be in India? Are they starting a Taliban in Hinduism?"" ""But whether I had said any of this or not, the BJP will seize on anything to promote their agenda of communal polarisation, because they have no other achievements to point to,"" he alleged. 
The senior Congress leader also accused the BJP of making efforts to take away the focus from real issues, claiming that on the real issues the saffron party will lose. Tharoor asserted that inclusive politics was good for the country, and alleged that the BJP had unleashed a ""climate of hatred, intolerance and division that will only hurt India"". He said that in the run up to the 2019 polls, the Congress would raise issues such as inflation, the rise in prices of fuel and cooking gas, increase in unemployment, the ""disaster of demonetisation"", the ""botched rollout of the GST"", agricultural stagnation and farmer suicides among others. Asked if the leadership issue among opposition parties would be settled after the general election depending upon the number of seats they get, Tharoor said, ""Probably. Each party has its own leader. Ours is Rahul Gandhi."" On the BJP's charge that the Congress indulges in appeasement of minorities, he asked that if the minorities had been appeased for so long, why were the Muslims disproportionately poor, less literate, more unemployed than other communities. ""The Congress wishes to help the weakest and most marginalised sections of our society — and that happens to include the minorities, but also Dalits, Adivasis, women, the disabled,"" he said.",Press Trust of India

Selling family silver is not divestment. I am watching who is doing what and will, if I see culpability, file a private criminal law complaint,” he tweeted. The government had, on 28 March, unveiled the plan to sell up to 76 percent stake in Air India and transfer the management control to private players, thus kicking off the ambitious strategic disinvestment process for the debt-laden national carrier. The move has come under criticism from the Opposition, with Trinamool Congress (TMC) attacking the Centre over the issue.

": All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday demanded quota for Muslims, hours after the Maharashtra legislature passed a bill proposing 16 percent reservation in education and government jobs for Marathas. The AIMIM said Muslims, too, deserve benefits of the reservation system as they have ""lived for generations in poverty."" In a tweet, the Lok Sabha from Hyderabad said depriving backward Muslims of their fair share in public employment and education was a grave injustice. ""I have consistently argued that there are backward castes in Muslims who have lived for generations in a cycle of poverty. Reservation is a tool that will break this cycle,"" he stated. AIMIM legislator from Maharashtra Imtiaz Jaleel questioned the BJP-led government's ""indifferent"" attitude towards the minority community. ""The state government has shown an indifferent attitude towards the Muslims by completely ignoring their valid demands for 5 percent reservation in education which 
was endorsed even by the High Court,"" Jaleel said. He said the ""hurriedly"" passed Bill for reservation to Marathas mentions the backwardness of the community on the basis of findings by a government-appointed commission. ""Going by the same logic, the plight of Muslims who have been regarded as socially, educationally and economically backward by three commissions - the Sachhar Commission, the Ranganath Mishra Commission and the Mehmood Rehman commission - should also have been given the same benefits as those being given to Marathas,"" he said. ""But irrespective of which party is in power nobody cares for the welfare and upliftment of minorities,"" Jaleel claimed.

"The Congress on Friday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of selling petrol and diesel to other nations at far cheaper rates than to Indian citizens and alleged the people, who were suffering due to the all-time high prices, would give it a befitting reply in elections for this ""betrayal"". Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala claimed the common man was suffering due to spiralling prices of such products and the government had ""looted"" the country of over Rs 11 lakh crore due to a levy of ""monstrous taxes"". ""The Modi government is selling cheap petrol and diesel to foreign countries, as Indians suffer due to the all-time high prices,"" he said. ""The monstrous taxes being levied by the government have resulted in the skyrocketing petrol and diesel prices. The Modi government has already profited by over Rs 11 lakh crore from draconian taxes on fuel,"" he alleged in a statement. The Congress leader claimed the petrol and diesel prices were at an all-time high and the common man, the middle class, the farmers, the transporters and small and medium businesses were bearing the brunt of it. ""Petrol and diesel in India are available in the range of Rs 78-86 and from Rs 70 to 75 respectively, but an RTI reply revealed the Modi government is selling petrol to 15 countries at just Rs 34 per litre and diesel to 29 countries at Rs 37 only. These include England, Australia, America, Malaysia and Israel. This is how the government betrayed and backstabbed the people of India,"" he alleged. Surjewala claimed in July 2017, the Congress had demanded that petrol and diesel be brought under the ambit of the GST, but the government and the BJP refused to listen. ""Now, the people of India will answer the BJP by giving it a befitting reply in the upcoming elections,"" he said.

Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera underlined his party's concern over the situation in the Valley, and asked the government to make public the measures it is taking for the security of the pilgrims of the Amarnath Yatra, which is scheduled to start on 28 June. Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Pawn Khera asked: The Congress has been waiting for four years for an all-party meeting on the Kashmir issue, Khera said. He accused the BJP of turning Kashmir into an ""abhorrent laboratory"" of its experiment of ""communal politics"" and alleged that the situation in the Valley is not only a failure of the central government's internal policies but also its foreign policy. The state of affairs in the Valley has become worse than what it was in 1990s, he told reporters, noting that the Election Commission is unable to hold the Lok Sabha bypolls in Anantnag due to law and order problems. A by-election recorded a paltry seven per cent polling under the present dispensation as against 71 per cent witnessed during the UPA's tenure, Khera said. ""Kashmir will be listed among one of the biggest failures of the Modi government. The situation there is becoming perhaps worse than what it was in the 1990s,"" he said, adding that 57 major attacks have taken place there in 27 days.

" Claiming that the Congress and the JD(S) have entered into a ""secret"" pact for the Karnataka Assembly polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday HD Deve Gowda's party was ""protecting"" the Congress. Addressing an election rally in Tumakuru, Modi alleged that the Congress, for years, spoke about poverty eradication only to garner votes, while neglecting farmers and the poor. ""Poll surveys, political pundits...everyone is saying the JD(S) cannot defeat Congress. They cannot form government. If anyone can change the government in Karnataka, it is the BJP."" ""If anyone is protecting the Congress, it is the JD(S)... Congress and JD(S) have a secret understanding...an understanding behind the curtains,"" Modi, who lavished praise on JD(S) patriarch and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda only a few days ago before training his guns on him, said. The Congress, Modi demanded, should make it clear if it had a secret understanding with JD(S) or not. He said it was with the support of Deve Gowda's party that the Congress had its mayor in Bengaluru. ""Why are you hiding this? Congress should have the courage to speak out the truth to people."" Modi, however, insisted he still has respect for Deve Gowda, who had announced before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls that he would commit suicide if he became the prime minister. The prime minister said despite Deve Gowda opposing him, when he came to Karnataka for campaigning during the Lok Sabha elections, he said the JD(S) leader should live for 100 years and serve the society.

Amidst all this commotion, key constituencies of Chamundeshwari, Varuna, Badami and Shikaripura kept politicos on edge with a high-voltage battle between heavyweights of Karnataka. According to the data on  , JD(S) leader GT Deve Gowda from Chamundeshwari is set to return as MLA in the constituency as he won by 36,042 votes. As early trends favoured a win for Deve Gowda, he claimed that the people of Karnataka have ""rejected"" Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.

Earlier, the chief minister had said he would win ""easily"" in Chamundeshwari, where he faced off against the popular Vokkaliga leader Gowda,   said.

The Rajya Sabha was supposed to debate the triple talaq bill on Wednesday, a week after it was passed by the Lok Sabha. The fate of the bill that seeks to criminalise instant divorce by Muslim husbands remained shrouded in suspense on Tuesday as the government virtually rejected an overwhelming demand from the Opposition for referring it to a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha for detailed consideration and rectify ""lacunae"" in the controversial legislation.

At the meeting, Leader of the House Arun Jaitley, also the Union Finance Minister, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister HN Ananth Kumar were believed to have told the Opposition that they should not insist on amendments to the bill or to recommend its reference to a parliamentary committee. However, the entire Opposition, including those friendly to the ruling BJP like TDP and AIADMK, demanded that the bill be referred to a select committee so that ""lacunae"" in the legislation could be rectified. In the BAC meeting, the Congress and other Opposition parties put up the proposal to send the bill to a select committee, sources privy to the discussion told  . The government insisted on bringing the bill to the House and take its sense before deciding about its final fate. The sources said the ministers were learnt to have told the Opposition members that the bill cannot be sent to a select committee on the basis of views expressed in the BAC and if they want to do so, they can defeat it on the floor of the House. The sources said there was a view in the treasury benches that most Opposition parties in case of a division will not vote against the legislation ""for gender justice"". The BAC has allotted time of four hours for a discussion on the bill on Wednesday. However, the picture may become clear at the meeting that Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu is going to have with floor leaders on Wednesday morning.

"The Supreme Court today agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the prevalent practices of polygamy and   among the Muslims and sought responses from the Centre and the Law Commission. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra considered the submission that an earlier five-judge constitution bench, in its 2017 verdict, had kept open the issue of polygamy and nikah halala while quashing  . Today, the bench, which also comprised Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, said a fresh five-judge constitution bench would be set up to deal with the constitutionality of nikah halala and polygamy. While polygamy allows a Muslim man to have four wives, nikah halala deals with the process in which a Muslim woman has to marry another person and get divorced from him before being allowed to marry her divorcee husband again. By a majority of 3:2, a five-judge constitution bench had earlier held triple talaq as unconstitutional in its judgement last year. The bench was hearing at least three petitions including some PILs challenging the practices on various grounds including that they violate Right to Equality and gender justice. Delhi BJP leader Aswini Kumar Upadhyay, who filed a PIL on March 5, claimed that the ban on polygamy and nikah-halala was the need of the hour to secure basic rights. The harm caused to the women due to the practices of triple talaq, polygamy and nikah-halala is violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the constitution and injurious to public order, morality and health, Upadhyay’s petition said. He sought a declaration “that the provisions of the IPC are applicable on all Indian citizens and triple talaq is a cruelty under section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the IPC, ‘nikah-halala’ is rape under section 375 (rape) of the IPC, and polygamy is an offence under section 494 (marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife) of the IPC.” On March 14, a Delhi-based woman had moved the apex court saying that by virtue of Muslim Personal Law, section 494 of IPC (marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife) was rendered inapplicable to this community and no married Muslim woman has the avenue of filing a complaint against her husband for the offence of bigamy. She sought to declare the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, unconstitutional and violative of Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) of the constitution in so far as it fails to secure for Indian Muslim women the protection from bigamy which has been statutorily secured for women in India belonging to other religions. The petitioner, who herself claimed to be a victim of such practices, has alleged that her husband and his family used to torture her for want of more dowry and she was ousted from the matrimonial home twice. She also alleged that her husband had married another woman without taking any legal divorce from her and the police had refused to lodge FIR under section 494 and 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the IPC stating that polygamy was permitted under the Sharia. Later, on March 18, a Hyderabad-based lawyer, had also challenged the practice of polygamy, claiming that all these types of marriages under the Muslim personal law violate the fundamental rights of Muslim women. The petition has contended that while the Muslim law allows a man to have multiple wives by way of the temporary marriages or polygamy, same permission is not extended to women. The petition has opposed the practice of nikah halala, where a divorced woman has to remarry and then get a talaq before being able to marry her first husband, as well as   and   – both temporary marriages where duration of the relationship is specified and agreed upon in advance.",PTI
" In yet another incident of lynching, a mentally disabled man was allegedly killed by villagers suspecting him of being a child-lifter in this district of Madhya Pradesh, police said on Tuesday. The incident took place at Singwar, 40 km from the district headquarters, on July 28. The area is predominantly tribal. On August 1, police learnt that a body was found floating in a well in the village, said superintendent of police K. Karthikeyan. The deceased was identified as Mukesh Gond, 27, the resident of Anuppur district, the SP told  . The probe revealed that four villagers — Jagdish, Chetram, Sanjay and Gangaram — were drinking on the night of July 28 when they saw Gond wandering aimlessly. When they called out to him, he hid in a school. The four dragged him out and asked him who he was and where he was from. Gond, who was apparently mentally-challenged, could only tell that he was from Annupur. The accused allegedly started beating him, calling him “ ” (child-lifter). More people gathered and he was beaten with sticks mercilessly, Karthikeyan said. The accused then allegedly tied his hands and feet and threw him into a well.

": The Delhi High Court is likely to pronounce on Friday its verdict on the plea of 20 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs challenging their disqualification for holding office-of-profit when they were appointed parliamentary secretaries. A bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar kept its decision pending since 28 February, when it had reserved the judgement after the legislators, Election Commission of India (EC) and other parties had concluded their arguments. During the arguments, the MLAs had told the court that EC's order disqualifying them for allegedly holding office-of-profit was passed in ""complete violation of natural justice"" as they were not given an opportunity to explain their stand before the poll panel. The bench was also requested by the legislators to remand their case back to the poll panel with a direction to hear the matter afresh. They had approached the high court challenging their disqualification after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the Election Commission's recommendation. Backing its recommendation to the President for AAP MLAs' disqualification, the poll panel had submitted that the legislators cannot claim that they were not holding office-of-profit. It had also claimed that these MLAs' pleas were not maintainable and were liable to be dismissed. The MLAs are accused of holding offices of profit, as they were appointed parliamentary secretaries to ministers in the Delhi government in March 2015. This was soon after they were elected to the Delhi Assembly. In September 2016, the Delhi High Court had ruled against their appointment as parliamentary secretaries, after hearing their pleas on a daily basis since 7 February. The high court had on 24 January refused to stay the Centre's notification disqualifying them, but had restrained the poll panel from taking any ""precipitate measures"" such as announcing dates for by polls to fill the vacancies. The Election Commission had on 19 January recommended the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs - Alka Lamba, Adarsh Shastri, Sanjeev Jha, Rajesh Gupta, Kailash Gahlot, Vijendra Garg, Praveen Kumar, Sharad Kumar, Madan Lal, Shiv Charan Goyal, Sarita Singh, Naresh Yadav, Rajesh Rishi, Anil Kumar, Som Dutt, Avtar Singh, Sukhvir Singh Dala, Manoj Kumar, Nitin Tyagi and Jarnail Singh.

" In a major embarrassment for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), two days before the Ramanagara assembly by-poll, its candidate against Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy's wife quit the contest on Thursday and returned to the Congress. With BJP's L Chandrashekhar withdrawing his candidature for the 3 November polls, Kumaraswamy's wife Anita Kumaraswamy, is expected to have a smooth sail facing a virtual no-contest.

"BJP minister Piyush Goyal sold a company, jointly owned by him and his wife, at nearly “1,000 times the face value” to the privately-owned Piramal Group, shortly after he became part of PM Narendra Modi’s cabinet in 2014 – according a report by  . Earlier this month, The Wire had also reported on the minister’s link to Shirdi Industries alleging  , to which Goyal had   by saying that there was no conflict of interest. While Goyal has not responded to the fresh allegations leveled by The Wire, the Piramal Group released a statement in response. The Piramal Group on Saturday, 28 April, released a statement refuting the allegations leveled by The Wire in its article, stating that it had purchased Flashnet from the Goyals at a fair value. Further, the statement clarified that the Group was involved in providing loans to various entities across sectors, and has not invested in the power sector till date. The statement then said that the purchase of Goyal’s firm did not benefit the ‘existing business’ of the group in any manner. The fresht report by   raises questions on the propriety of the sale between Goyal and the Piramal Group, as the transaction reportedly finds no mention in the declaration filed by Goyal in the PM’s office in 2014, nor when took oath as a minister in 2015. The Wire reports that Goyal and his wife began Flashnet Info Solutions (India) Private Limited in 2000, and owned 99.9 percent of the stock. While Goyal did state the company in his ‘statutory listing of pecuniary interests’ with Rajya Sabha, after having become a member in 2010, he failed to declare his ownership of the firm in 2014, nor its sale in 2015. Further, Goyal in 2014, mentioned the book value of his of his “unquoted securities” at Rs 1,01,300. His share in Flashnet, amounting to 53.95 percent, as well as his wife’s share of 43.95 percent were sold off to Primal in September 2014. Goyal’s Rajya Sabha nomination of 2016 too, stood bereft of the value of the shares sold, alleged The Wire. Further, the year Piramal Group bought Goyal’s firm, it posted a loss of around Rs 119 crore, the report noted. While neither Priamal nor Goyal disclosed the sale value of the shares to The Wire, the report quotes a board resolution of Piramal Enterprises, which “authorised the purchase of the entire stock of 50,070 shares for a consideration not exceeding Rs 10,000 per share.” The next year’s company filings listed by Piramal Group and accessed by The Wire suggested that a total of Rs 48 crore was placed on the Goyal family’s shares – translating to a cost of Rs 9,586 per share. When Flashnet was sold, the company reportedly declared a profit of Rs 34 lakh. However, after it was purchased by Piramal Group, the company was renamed Aasan Info (Solutions) India Private Ltd, and listed its net value at only Rs 10.9 crore. The Wire also alleges that Goyal was a director on the board from 25 November 2004 to 26 May 2014, which was when he took charge as Minister of Power. And while he stepped down as director, he and his wife continued to hold 99 percent of the company, the report alleged. Further, the report notes that Rajya Sabha MPs are required to declare their monetary holdings 90 days after taking their oath, and notify any changes with regard the same. While Goyal reportedly did mention his stake in Flashnet in 2011 and the remuneration he drew as director in 2015, it is reportedly unknown if he declared the change in ownership after the sale. Reacting to the allegations levelled by The Wire in its report, the Congress on Saturday, 28 April, questioned Goyal’s intentions of having sold his firm at “almost 1000 percent premium”. Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said: Khera further questioned the Prime Minister to answer as to why the party’s former treasurer was “involved in a murky web of financial dealings.” He also alleged that Flashnet’s name was immediately changed post-sale so as to hide any conflict of interest. The BJP meanwhile released a   in response to Congress’s press conference, rubbishing the claims laid forward by the opposition party. In its statement, the BJP said that Goyal was an “eminent chartered accountant”, who carried out his professional work through companies he owned prior to becoming a minister in 2014. The party said in its statement: Meanwhile, several politicos took to Twitter to question Goyal on his perceived impropriety. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

""Two three instances of Nirav Modi, (Mehul) Choksi and Vijay Mallya...but they are damaging the image of the country and they are damaging the image of the system.

He expressed hope that Parliament would function and have meaningful and constructive debate on this important issue. Stressing that there is no use in finding fault in whose regime the frauds took place, he said the lawmaker should find out where does the fault lies. ""The issue is of people losing confidence in the banking system. This is the larger issue. Who is accountable and what assurance they are giving to depositors. These are larger issues,"" Naidu said. When the proposal came up for discussion in the Rajya Sabha on bank frauds, Naidu said he had permitted the debate but ""unfortunately"" discussion is not happening.

He said his ongoing effort was not aimed at some kind of a 'third front'.It was not a mere alignment of political parties but ""that of the people"" of the country, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi supremo told reporters in a joint press meet with Stalin. Rao parried a question on whether he was projecting West Bengal chief minister  , whom he had recently met, as the prime ministerial candidate in the 2019 elections. The efforts were aimed at the country's betterment, better economy and better opportunities for the youth, he said. ""We have not proposed any third, fourth or fifth front, this so-called front is created by media. We have never announced a third front...it is not a mere alignment of political parties but an alignment of people of India, the masses and unemployed youth of India,"" he said.

"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) looks set to storm to victory in Karnataka with a simple majority, thereby being in a position to form government on its own without any help from allies. If it does so, BS Yeddyurappa, the party's pre-poll chief ministerial candidate, will take oath to become chief minister for the third time. Incidentally, the BJP leader and party's MLA from Shikaripura constituency, had confidently predicted a victory back on 2 May, even spelling out the details of his oath-taking ceremony. In an address to party workers at Shivamoga on 2 May,  , ""17 May is a Thursday and 18 May is a Friday. We have to look at the convenient time of the prime minister. Chief ministers of other states too will attend the event... My oath-taking at Vidhana Soudha as chief minister of Karnataka is inevitable. Nobody should have any doubt about it."" Back when he made this announcement, the state was still on a knife's edge, and Yeddyurappa's confidence was seen as premature. However, the victory for BJP would make it appear like he had played his cards right.

Lingayats, along with the numerically strong Veerashaivas, number over 17 percent of Karnataka's population, as   has argued. It said that Lingayats are the dominant community in over 100 out of the state's 224 constituencies, most of them from north Karnataka. Nine of its chief ministers have been Lingayats. But with Yeddyurappa having been the BJP's face in the state for over three decades, time in which he has been sent to the Karnataka Assembly on six different occasions, the party has always been in pole position to clinch the community's vote. It was believed that Congress' attempt to give the community a religious minority card was an attempt to draw some of this support away from the saffron party. Clearly, it has not worked. Speaking to Firstpost in April this year, Yeddyurappa had said as much. He denied that the community would tilt towards the Congress, and warned the party that it would be taught ""a lesson of a lifetime"". ""Congress will taste a lesson of a lifetime for its misadventure in this religious issue. The anger and resentment of the people throughout the state is intense and widespread. Even ardent supporters of Congress are angry and want to teach Siddaramaiah a lesson for interfering in religious affairs. Nobody tolerates dividing the society. BJP draws strength and support from all religious denominations cutting across caste and creed and all rungs of the society,"" he said. The Congress had also used the issue of Yeddyurappa's arrest and jail stint for a land grab case in 2011 to criticise the BJP. Yeddyurappa was   for monetary gain. Two Bengaluru advocates had filed five cases against Yeddyurappa, his two sons, son-in-law and others, accusing them of denotifying the government land. Yeddyurappa became the first accused in all the five cases of illegal land denotification for monetary gains. He became the first former chief minister in the state's history to have an arrest warrant against his name. He then went on to spend 25 days in jail, before being released from Bangalore Central Prison. Later, in 2016, a CBI court had cleared Yeddyurappa and his sons. The Karnataka High Court had initially quashed all charges against Yeddyurappa, following which the Samaja Parivartana Samudaya NGO moved the Supreme Court, which asked the CBI to re-investigate the matter.

""Those who have diverted from the mainstream should be brought back,"" Babbar said, adding that picking up a gun was not a solution. Queried about whether he was claiming that Naxals were revolutionaries, Babbar said, ""I want to clarify that I said the issue can be solved through talks with those (Naxals) who call themselves revolutionaries by indulging in acts of terrorism."" He refuted BJP allegations, made on several occasions, that the Congress was ""backing"" Naxals. ""The Congress party had lost its state leadership (in Naxal attack in May 2013).

" A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday seeking lodging of an FIR and court-monitored probe by an independent agency into the alleged physical and sexual abuse of inmates in 14 shelter homes in Bihar as highlighted in a report. The Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) report was submitted to the Bihar government and it has highlighted gross violations of human rights of inmates in 15 shelter homes in the state, including the Muzaffarpur shelter, whose affairs are now being investigated by the CBI. The plea filed by journalist Nivedita Jha, through advocate Fauzia Shakil, has sought “registration of an FIR and independent investigations or a court-monitored probe into the affairs of these 14 (other) shelter homes in Bihar mentioned in the TISS report”. It also sought direction to the authorities to look into the aspect of rehabilitation of the victims of alleged sexual and physical abuse in these 14 shelter homes and to pay compensation to them. The plea has alleged that the Bihar government has not conducted any probe into the allegations of irregularities, sexual and physical abuse in the 14 shelter homes highlighted in the TISS report. “No FIR has been lodged and no investigation/enquiry has been undertaken by any authority into the glaring irregularities and instances of sexual and physical abuse of the residents. It is most respectfully submitted that as per the information received from the members of the civil society, most of these 14 shelter homes are still functioning in the same way,” it said. The plea, while referring to the media reports, said that without conducting any probe into the allegations of sexual and physical abuse, the state was in the process of taking over the management of these shelter homes. “It is pertinent to point out here that the TISS report highlighted instances of sexual abuse in the children homes run by the state government in Araria and Arrah districts of Bihar. Thus an inference can be drawn that children homes managed by a respondent state are no-better managed than the other shelter homes administered by these NGOs,” it claimed. The plea said the investigation into the Muzaffarpur shelter home has shocked the nation and has exposed the ghastly nature of sexual and physical abuse in which hapless minor girls were subjected to including instances where minor girls were drugged and raped. “It has brought to light the involvement of senior politicians and bureaucrats including the members of the child protection units,” said the petition, which is likely to be taken up for hearing by the court next week. It said the delay in arresting former minister Manju Verma in the state in a connected matter exposes the deep police-politician nexus in Bihar and there are several instances of inaction by police and members of the state administration. Verma has surrendered before the district court in Begusarai on November 20 in connection with an Arms Act case. On November 12, the apex court had said it was “quite shocked” that the Bihar police was unable to trace and arrest Verma, who had stepped down from the cabinet in the wake of the Muzaffarpur shelter home scandal, in a case related to the alleged recovery of illegal ammunition from her house. Verma had resigned as the social welfare minister after it came to light that her husband Chandrashekhar Verma had spoken to Brajesh Thakur, the prime accused in the Muzaffarpur case, several times between January and June. Thakur’s NGO was running the shelter where several women inmates were allegedly raped and sexually abused. On October 31, the apex court had expressed displeasure over the failure of the police in arresting Manju Verma, whose anticipatory bail plea was dismissed by the Patna high court on October 9. Verma’s husband had earlier surrendered before a court in Begusarai in connection with the case related to the recovery of ammunition. The top court had last month directed that Thakur be shifted to the high-security jail in Punjab’s Patiala from a jail in Bihar’s Bhagalpur. An FIR was lodged on May 31 against 11 people, including Thakur, following the TISS report. The probe was later taken over by the CBI and 17 people have been arrested so far.",PTI
"Four political turncoats, who had resigned from their membership in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council in 2017 to facilitate Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, his two deputies and two other cabinet colleagues to get the membership of the Upper House of the state Legislature, were on Sunday named by the BJP as its candidates for the upcoming Legislative Council polls. In a statement issued in Lucknow, the party announced the names of 10 candidates for the 26 April polls. The BJP candidates are — state ministers Mahendra Singh and Mohsin Raza, Sarojini Agarwal, Bukkal Nawab, Yashwant Singh, Jaiveer Singh, Vidhyasagar Sonkar, Vijay Bahadur Pathak, Ashok Kataria and Ashok Dhawan. Kataria, Sonkar and Pathak are general secretaries of the state BJP unit, while Dhawan, a former MLC, hails from Varanasi. Meanwhile, Apna Dal (Sonelal) spokesperson Arvind Sharma, in an official statement, said, ""The president of Apna Dal (Sonelal), Ashish Singh Patel, will be the candidate for the 11th seat left by the BJP for the party."" In September last year, Adityanath, his two deputies and two ministers were declared elected unopposed to the state Legislative Council. No other candidate was in the fray for the bypolls to the five seats in the Upper House. The chief minister had filed his nomination for the seat vacated by Samajwadi Party (SP) member Yashwant, while Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had filed his papers for the seat held by SP member Bukkal Nawab. Their term was to expire in July, 2022. Adityanath had taken over as the chief minister on 19 March 2017. He had to become a legislator within the stipulated six months since assuming office. Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma had filed his nomination for the seat vacated by Ashok Bajpai and Swatantra Dev Singh for the seat vacated by SP member Sarojni Agarwal. Their terms were to expire in January, 2021. Raza, the only Muslim minister in the Adityanath cabinet, had filed his nomination for the seat vacated by BSP member Thakur Jaiveer Singh. Bajpai was recently elected as a Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, the leaders of the ruling BJP sounded confident of bagging 11 of the 13 seats going to the polls on 26 April. The BJP and its allies enjoy a brute majority of 324 in the 403-member state Assembly. Arithmetically, they are likely to win 11 of the 13 seats comfortably and still be left with some additional votes. State BJP vice-president JPS Rathore said to ensure victory, a candidate needed 29 first-preference votes. The notification for the Legislative Council polls was issued on April 9. The last date for filing of nominations is 16 April. The scrutiny of nominations will be done on 17 April, while the last date for withdrawal of candidature is 19 April. ""We are sure of winning 11 of the 13 Legislative Council seats going to the polls,"" state BJP spokesperson Navin Srivastava told  . Of the remaining two seats, the SP has given up one to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The SP, headed by Akhilesh Yadav, had fielded two candidates, but withdrew one of them, paving the way for Mayawati's party to contest one seat as a quid pro quo (a favour or advantage granted in return for something) for her support to the SP in the bypolls to the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats, which halted the saffron party's victory march in the bastion of Adityanath (in Gorakhpur). In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had won the Phulpur seat for the first time. In the recently-concluded Rajya Sabha polls, it was a sweet revenge for the BJP as it ensured the victory of all its nine candidates, days after it lost the two crucial Lok Sabha seats to the SP. Besides Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the others who had made it to the Upper House of Parliament from the party were Ashok Bajpai, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Sakal Deep Rajbhar, Kanta Kardam, Anil Jain, Harnath Singh Yadav, GVL Narasimha Rao and Anil Kumar Agarwal, who pulled off a surprise win with the help of second-preference votes. The other candidates, including the SP's Jaya Bachchan, had won on the basis of first-preference votes. In the 100-member Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council, the BJP has only 13 representatives, the SP 61, the BSP nine, the Congress two, the RLD one and others 12. Two seats are vacant. SP spokesperson and MLC Sunil Singh Sajan said the SP-BSP combine would comfortably win the two Legislative Council seats. ""The SP is contesting from one seat in the Legislative Council polls. Initially, we had decided to contest from two seats, but later we decided to give one seat to the BSP to strengthen our electoral understanding,"" he added. According to the Election Commission (EC), the tenure of 13 MLCs, including SP national president Akhilesh Yadav and two ministers in the Adityanath government -- Mahendra Kumar Singh and Mohsin Raza — will end on 5 May. Of the 13 seats falling vacant, seven were held by the SP, two each by the BJP and the BSP and one by the RLD. The 13th seat, which was held by former SP minister Ambika Chaudhary, fell vacant when he switched over to the BSP. Apart from the SP chief, six other MLCs from the party, whose terms are coming to an end are its state unit chief Naresh Chandra Uttam, senior spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary, Umar Ali Khan, Madhu Gupta, Ramsakal Gurjar and Vijay Yadav. The MLCs of other parties, whose terms end on 5 May, are Vijay Pratap and Sunil Kumar Chittor (both from the BSP) and Chaudhary Mushtaq, the lone RLD member. Though the ruling NDA has 324 MLAs in the 403-member state Assembly, it may not get the required strength in the Upper House to get the bills passed, even after winning 11 of the 13 seats. During the winter session of the state legislature last year, the Adityanath government had suffered an embarrassment when it failed to ensure the passage of the Uttar Pradesh Control of Organised Crime (UPCOC) Bill in the Upper House.",PTI

Facebook has been in the eye of a storm ever since data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal information of millions of users through a game app. The data was allegedly used by the firm to influence, at times manipulate, voters' views at the behest of politicians. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for having failed to ensure that the the social networking site was foolproof. Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said that her team had identified three major areas to focus on. In an article that Facebook put out on  , Lyons claimed that this new approach will help people to ""stay informed and diametrically reduce the reach of false stories. Although false news does not violate our community standards, it often violates our policies in other categories, such as spam, hate speech or fake accounts, which we remove,” Lyons said. Facebook, from now onwards, will suspend pages that are found to be concealing their real identities and operating out of non-native countries. Facebook said that it has started taking action against pages and websites that share fake news stories on a regular basis, thereby decreasing their news distribution. ""Another part of our strategy in some countries is partnering with third-party fact-checkers to review and rate the accuracy of articles and posts on Facebook,"" Lyons wrote.

"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday said the Rafale fighter deal will prove the ""last nail in the coffin"" of the BJP government. Alleging that Narendra Modi government agreed to pay an ""astronomical price"" for procuring the fighter jets from France, AAP MP Sanjay Singh termed the transaction as the ""deal of scams"". Under fire over the quantum of cost in procurement of jets, the BJP-led NDA government refused to disclose details of the deal citing a secrecy clause in the agreement. ""It is a well-known fact that in 2012 the then UPA government was all set to seal the deal at Rs 500 crore per jet, including technology transfer which would have ensured that the technology could be recreated in the state-run HAL,"" Singh said.

In his letter, the Archbishop had raised concerns over the current “turbulent political atmosphere” which has threatened the democratic institutions and social fabric of the country. However, Ribeiro said, “He is not the only Indian to have raised such concerns. I know countless Hindus, good, solid citizens of our country, who have condemned the covert and overt attempts to demolish institutions, attacks that portend the end of our secular fabric.” Responding to Union Minister KJ Alphon’s statement urging ‘godmen’ to stay away from political comments, Ribiero pointed out that the BJP has appointed a ‘godman’ as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Ribeiro wrote that the BJP government, led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was different from the one that is ruling now. The current Modi government raises doubts and questions the patriotism of the minorities. Ribeiro noted that although he has lived and worked predominantly with Hindus, he is still trying to figure out what “Hindu Rashtra” really means.

He added that joining hands with the JD(S) in case Congress fails to get majority is not being looked at as an option as his party is confident of coming to power on its own, and also that the HD Deve Gowda-led outfit is ""not dependable"".

Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Thursday that Jaitley's blogs are a clear case of finding lost political relevance by ""churning out unadulterated lies"". The Congress' response came over a week after Jaitley wrote a lengthy blog post (on 6 June) on Facebook  . "" ,"" he wrote. Jaitley's comment had come on the same day Rahul targeted the Narendra Modi government during a rally in Madhya Pradesh's Mandsaur. The Union minister wrote a point-by-point rebuttal of the arguments raised by Rahul, denying the Congress president's allegation that the Central government waived the loans of Rs 2.5 lakh crore of the 15 top industrialists, saying this is factually and completely false. The government, he said, has not waived a single rupee due from any industrialist. ""The facts are to the contrary,"" Jaitley wrote in his post. The Union minister also said those who owed money to the banks and other creditors have been declared insolvent and removed from their companies by Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) enacted by the Modi government. ""These loans were given largely during the UPA Government,"" said Jaitley. On Gandhi's comment that Modi has given Rs 35,000 crore each to two diamond jewellers who have now escaped out of the country, Jaitley said this is factually false. He added that the banking fraud started in 2011 when the UPA II was in power and it was only detected during the NDA period. Two days later, Jaitley wrote another post, this time elaborating on the IBC and what it entails. ""Sound and structured real estate developers would remain. The 'fly by night' operators would be eliminated. Projects would be completed in reasonable time and investors would get their share of allotments expeditiously,"" he wrote. Jaitley also said that construction is recording a double-digit growth and real estate regulator RERA and the new ordinance would only catalyse this process further. The new ordinance equates an ""allottee"" of a ""real estate project"" to be a person having a commercial effect of borrowing as he is now treated as a financial creditor, Jaitley said. ""He can initiate corporate insolvency for a resolution against the errant developer. He acquires the right to be on the committee of creditors. He gets voting right.

""For a president of a national party not to understand this basic procedure of bank functioning should be a matter of concern to the entire party as also the country.

Reports emerged on Monday about a large number of postal ballots being discovered in a hotel room in Badami in Karnataka. The Election Commission issued a clarification on Tuesday morning that an investigation by the Tahsildar and the Assistant Returning Officer yielded only two pages of instructions on how to exercise postal ballot but no postal ballots. Counting for the Karnataka Assembly election 2018 will be held across a total of 38 centres in 33 election districts. Chitradurga, Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru have two centres, Tumakuru has three and the rest of the districts one each. Security has been tightened across Karnataka with forces deployed outside counting centres ahead of counting of votes at 8 am on Tuesday. The counting of votes for the Karnataka Assembly elections 2018 will be taken up on Tuesday with pollsters saying they would likely go down to the wire, with a neck and neck race between the state's ruling Congress and challenger BJP. Several exit polls have predicted a hung Assembly in Karnataka, and said former prime minister HD Deve Gowda's JD(S) would play the role of the kingmaker. In one of the most high-profile and bitterly fought elections in recent times, 222 of the 224 seats went to polls on 12 May. Polling for RR Nagar seat was deferred on account of alleged electoral malpractices, while it was countermanded in Jayanagar seat following the death of the BJP candidate. Counting of votes would begin at 8 am in nearly 40 counting centres, election office sources said. The trends are likely to begin to trickle within an hour and all results are expected to be declared by late evening. In case of a clear verdict in favour of the Congress, the grand old party will have broken the jinx of no political party retaining the reins of the state since 1985, when the erstwhile Janata Dal formed the government under Ramakrishna Hegde for a second consecutive term. It is, however, unclear if Siddaramaiah, a backward class leader with a formidable reputation, will be the next chief minister in the event of a Congress victory. Though the Congress had said he would be its face in the elections, it stopped short of declaring him the party's chief ministerial candidate. Siddaramaiah caused a political flutter when he said yesterday that he was ready to make way for a Dalit chief minister if the Congress high command so decided, a statement many felt was aimed at keeping the JD(S) in good humour so as to stitch an alliance in case of a fractured mandate. Siddramaiah is a former JD(S) man and his ties with Deve Gowda's party continue to be strained. ""I am confident that the Congress would win the elections with a majority and I would be the chief minister,"" Siddaramaiah had told journalists earlier. However, when asked on Sunday if he was ready to make way for a Dalit leader as chief minister, he said,""I have no objection. I am not against anybody but the decision has to be left to the high command."" He, however, said the high command would also consider the views of the winning candidates before deciding the next chief minister. Since the Congress had not declared its chief ministerial candidate, Dalit veterans in the party like its leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and state Congress chief G Parameshwara are being seen as possible alternatives. Kharge had recently told   he was ready to take up any role assigned to him by the party. A victory in Karnataka would help boost the sagging morale of the Congress, which is on a downhill journey, losing state after state since Narendra Modi came to power at the Centre. Losing Karnataka will drastically weaken its claim for the leadership of a broader anti-BJP alliance that is being talked about. A victory for the BJP, on the other hand, will reflect the enduring charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his capacity to power his party to victory across the country, clearing demographic and topographical obstacles. It would also further galvanise the BJP cadre before the Assembly elections in party-ruled Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh later this year. The JD(S) has also claimed it would win a majority and that its chief ministerial candidate HD Kumaraswamy will be the ""king"" and not the ""kingmaker"". The party may or may not win the elections, but will play the kingmaker if the electorate gives a split verdict, making Deve Gowda an important player in the state politics once again. With the JD(S) having had partnered with both BJP and Congress in the past, it would be tough to predict which way it will go this time in the event of a hung House. One of the possible scenarios could be the coming together of the Congress and the JD(S), as had happened in 2004 when they formed the government under Congress heavyweight Dharm Singh after the state elected a hung House. If that happens, JD(S) may not agree to Siddaramaiah heading a coalition government and likely want a Dalit leader at the helm The Congress is taking no chances in Karnataka and has sent in its top guns to avoid a repeat of the Goa and Manipur fiascos in the past, where it failed to form a government despite emerging as the largest party. The party has sent senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ashok Gehlot to the southern state where results of the Assembly polls would be out on Tuesday. Sources said Azad and Gehlot have reached Bangalore and have met chief minister Siddharamaiah and other party leaders. They are also likely to meet JD-S leaders, including H D Deve Gowda and his son Kumaraswamy, in case it fails to get a majority of its own.",FP Staff
"Two more prosecution witnesses on April 20 turned hostile in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh and Tulsiram Prajapati alleged fake encounter cases, taking the number of witnesses who didn’t support the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) case to 52. The court here has examined 76 witnesses so far. Rafique Hafiz and Firoze Khan, deposing before Special Judge S.J. Sharma here, said they had not given any statement to the CBI, contrary to the agency’s claim. They said they had visited the agency’s office only once and the CBI had taken down their names and addresses. Special public prosecutor B.P. Raju then declared them hostile. According to the CBI, Hafiz and Khan had said that they were arrested in a murder case (both were acquitted later), and Prajapati, who met them in a Rajasthan jail, told them that he and Shaikh were going to extort Rs 20 crore each from RK  Marbles and Sangam Textiles. However, Gujarat police officer Abhay Chudasama picked up Prajapati, Shaikh and Shaikh’s wife Kausar Bi. All three were brought to Ahmedabad on November 24, 2005, where Chudasma and IPS officer D.G. Vanzara assured them that they were arresting Shaikh only under political pressure, Prajapati told the two, according to the CBI. The police officers had told Shaikh that he would soon get bail, the agency said, citing the two witnesses. Prajapati further allegedly told Khan and Hafiz that that out of crores of rupees received from RK Marbles and Sangam Textiles, the police got a very meagre share while a major chunk went to then Rajasthan Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria, according to the CBI. Chudasama, Vanzara and Kataria have been discharged from the Shaikh encounter case. Prajapati allegedly also told the two, the CBI said, that Vanzara and Chudasama were paying his jail expenses and legal fees. Though he was an eyewitness to Shaikh’s encounter, he was afraid to speak out as he apprehended threat to his life, he allegedly told the duo. However, as per the testimonies of the two witnesses yesterday, they had given no such statement to the CBI, which is a setback to the agency’s case. Shaikh, an alleged gangster with terror links, and his wife Kausar Bi were allegedly abducted by the Gujarat police’s Anti-Terrorism Squad from Hyderabad on their way to Sangli in Maharashtra in November 2005. According to the prosecution, Shaikh was killed in a staged encounter. Kausar Bi, who disappeared, was also killed.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi's chances of getting re-elected in the 2019 elections have slipped from “99 per cent” in 2017 to “50 per cent”, says economic analyst Ruchir Sharma, noting that a fragmented opposition is showing signs of coming together. The BJP won with 31 per cent vote share in 2014 because the opposition was fragmented, seat share was disproportionate and its vote was concentrated, said the New York based columnist and economist who is working on his new book “Democracy on Road”. “However, the odds have shifted dramatically. Now it is a 50:50 election and a lot is going to come down to alliances again. The opposition, from being totally fragmented, is now actually showing signs of coming together … that's India for you, nobody likes if it becomes one-sided,” Sharma told PTI in an exclusive interview. The economist has a keen eye on world politics, especially India. His new book, which is expected to hit the stands in February ahead of the 2019 elections, claims to provide an insightful account of how Indian democracy works, using elections as a lens. Sharma, who has covered two dozen elections in India since 1990s, recalls the 2004 elections and argues that the “gap in popularity” between then prime minister, the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and the opposition is similar to the situation between Modi and the present opposition today. You (BJP) won with 31 per cent vote share because the opposition was fragmented, seat share was disproportionate and the BJP’s vote was concentrated. In 2004, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) conceded defeat and the Congress returned to power with Manmohan Singh being appointed prime minister. Describing Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats, as a “microcosm of India”, Sharma said if there is an alliance between the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party in the state, they will “sweep the elections”. Otherwise, it will be the BJP, “as simple as that”. According to Sharma, the vote in Uttar Pradesh is still decided on the basis of caste. Of 26 election trips that he has taken across the country, six or seven have been in Uttar Pradesh, he said. “This is how I try to go the whole circle in the book,” Sharma said, adding that he plans to do one more election trip for the book during the upcoming state election in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. To be published by Penguin Random House India, the book is touted to be a “must read before the 2019 elections”. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

"The BJP on Tuesday announced that it is   with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, saying that it has become untenable to continue in the government. BJP's general secretary Ram Madhav, while addressing a press conference, said that terrorism, violence and radicalisation have risen and fundamental rights of the citizens are in danger in the Valley. This comes soon after BJP president Amit Shah called for an urgent meeting of all Jammu and Kashmir BJP ministers and some top leaders in New Delhi on Tuesday. Sources had told   that the meeting was likely convened following differences between the PDP and BJP over the issue of the recent Ramzan ceasefire. The ceasefire was just the recent thaw to plague the BJP-PDP alliance in the state. The   that the Ramzan ceasefire would not be extended and anti-terror operations would resume in the state. Reports said that the decision to end the ceasefire had upset the PDP. Sources told  that PDP maintained that the Centre needs to reach out to the separatists. Meanwhile, the BJP felt the   let go of an opportunity by not making use of the ceasefire to work for peace. The report further said that the ceasefire initiative was the brainchild of Mehbooba Mufti, and the state BJP unit had fought it tooth and nail. It had even asked the Centre to spike her recommendation, arguing that ""we should not do anything to demoralise the security forces"". Shortly after announcing an end to the ceasefire, the Centre said that it wants to ensure that the upcoming Amarnath Yatra starting 28 June is conducted peacefully. The BJP-PDP alliance in Jammu and Kashmir has often been termed as the 'meeting of the  '. It has had a rocky ride since the start and been fraught with differences. PDP sources had told  that Mufti had taken a strong exception to the BJP ministers pointing fingers at the crime branch probe into the case which could have also demoralised the forces. Mufti had even raised the issue of BJP leaders Lal Singh and CP Ganga “obstructing the process of justice” in the Kathua case with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

She was, however, rebuffed by the leaders of the BJP, saying they are not ready to start any dialogue with those who oppose India, including Hurriyat Conference.

"Union minister Jayant Sinha on Thursday challenged Congress president Rahul Gandhi to an open debate on the Ramgarh lynching case. Sinha's challenge comes after  for felicitating eight convicts in the case who were granted bail by the Jharkhand High Court. ""Shri Rahul Gandhi  has taken the attack against me to a personal level. He has attacked my education, values, and humanity. I challenge him to a live debate in Hindi or in English on the Ramgarh lynching case. If he thinks that my personal conduct is disgusting then let's debate in a civilised manner. Let him not hide behind his social media handles and play shoot-and-scoot politics. Our great democracy deserves no less,"" Sinha said in a statement on Twitter.   On Tuesday, Rahul termed Sinha's action ""disgusting"" and sought support for a petition that seeks withdrawal of Sinha's Harvard alumni status. Rahul tweeted:  The petition by Prateek Kanwal, a 2018 graduate from Harvard University, said that action by the BJP minister ""shocked the nation and brought disrepute to our great institution"". The petition said Sinha's ""callous and insensitive actions"" generated tremendous anger in India and have been widely reported by the media. On the subject of his degree, Sinha said he was born in a small town in Bihar and would not care if his degree is revoked. He told  ""I am not worried about my Harvard degree being revoked. I was born in Giridih. I went from Hazaribagh to Harvard. It's my education that has taught me that a democracy is based on inalienable human rights. I challenge Rahul Gandhi to debate."" Facing intense criticism from the Opposition over felicitating the convicts, Sinha   on Wednesday, and added that the matter was sub judice and his actions were not intended to propagate the idea of lynching. He said he believed the men to be innocent. ""If by garlanding them an impression has gone out that I support such vigilantism then I express regret over it,"" he said. ""I have said many times that the matter is still sub judice. It won't be fair to talk on this. Law will take its own course. We have always worked towards punishing the guilty and sparing the innocent,"" he said.

": Former Union Minister and Odisha MLA Dilip Roy, and senior BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra resigned from the party on Friday. Besides sending a joint resignation letter to BJP president Amit Shah, Roy, who represents Rourkela constituency in the Odisha Assembly, also resigned as legislator. Roy said he called on Assembly Speaker Pradip Amat Friday morning and tendered his resignation from the membership of the House. 
""It is with deep anguish that I have decided to quit as the member of State Legislative Assembly as well as from the membership of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" Roy said in a twitter post. Both the leaders had for a long been alleging delay in construction of a second bridge over the Brahmani river, establishment of a super-speciality hospital in Rourkela and lack of job opportunities for local youths in Paradip oil refinery. Mohapatra told reporters that the interest of the state is important and their future course would be announced after about a fortnight. He also alleged that their suggestions and views were ignored by the party. In the resignation letter to the BJP national president, Roy and Mahapatra said, ""We regret to state that despite repeated efforts in appraising you on the sorry state of affairs of the party here, neither you nor any senior central party leader bothered to consult, review or take corrective measures."" ""Be it the Mahanadi water issue or the unfulfilled promised of a second bridge over the Brahmani river, the super-speciality hospital at Rourkela or the dreams of lakhs of jobs for Odia youth which we sold at Paradip during the inauguration of the Oil Refinery - nothing, absolutely nothing materialised,"" it said. The letter claimed that the people of Odisha were ""disillusioned."" ""Several leaders in the party here shared our concerns, but remain silent fearing denial of tickets. You would agree that such silence is a bad sign for any democratic party,"" it said. ""Well-meaning suggestions by us were construed as a threat by certain ego-centric self-serving politicians who resorted to dirty tricks and a campaign was launched in our respective constituencies to try and deride us,"" the letter said. Noting that they cannot be treated as ""furniture"" in the party, Roy and Mahapatra said, ""For us, the interest of the state is supreme. We have never ever compromised our self-respect or the interest of the state for any post, power or ticket."" The two leaders stressed that they guard the interest of the people of the state and their constituency, to whom they are answerable. Describing defeat of the party with a margin of 40,000 votes at Bijepur bypoll a ""shocker"", they said this reflected the ""disenchantment"" of the people with the BJP because of the manner in which the party was functioning. Roy said due to the charismatic presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the progressive change of BJP, he had envisioned development works for Rourkela and had promised to fulfil the long-ignored dream and aspirations of the people who had reposed their faith in him. ""Now, I acknowledge my failure in living up to their expectations and therefore, taking the moral responsibility, I have decided to quit as the member of the state Legislative Assembly as well as from the membership of BJP,"" Roy said.

Manisha Saxena said that all files are being moved and allegations that work is being hampered are wrong. Hours before AAP's protest march to the prime minister's residence, the Delhi Police said no permission was sought for it. Four metro rail stations – Central Secretariat, Patel Chowk, Udyog Bhawan and Lok Kalyan Marg – will be closed to prevent AAP workers and supporters to reach Mandi House, venue of the march scheduled at 4 pm. ""Those trying to take out the march will be detained since no permission has been sought for it,"" a police officer told  . Reacting on the development, the AAP leadership alleged that the Delhi Police was trying to stop people from joining the march. ""Police has got several metro stations closed down. Barricades have been erected all over Delhi and police is going door to door asking people if they were going for the march. People are being stopped from going for the march,"" Delhi AAP chief Gopal Rai said. Sitaram Yechury will join the AAP protest march to the Prime Minister's Office on Sunday evening. People will assemble at Mandi House at 4 pm and march to the PMO under the party banner to support Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. However, Delhi Police said that the party has not applied for permission for a protest march. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, along with the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala, requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the problems of the Delhi government immediately. Kejriwal slammed Delhi L-G for attending the NITI Aayog meet on Sunday. He tweeted that he did not authorise the L-G to replace him in the meet.

Kejriwal and three Cabinet colleagues have been staying put in a waiting room at Raj Niwas, protesting against what they call is a strike by the bureaucrats in the national capital, and have sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention in solving what they termed a ""constitutional crisis”. On Saturday, Kejriwal received the support of chief ministers of West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. After their request for permission to meet the Aam Aadmi Party chief at the LG's office was “verbally” denied, West Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, Karnataka's HD Kumaraswamy, Andhra Pradesh's N Chandrababu Naidu and Kerala's Pinarayi Vijayan reached the chief minister's home in the evening. The open support to Kejriwal by the four regional heavyweights — from Trinamool Congress, Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Janata Dal (Secular) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) — comes amid opposition's efforts to cobble together a rainbow coalition ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But the Congress, which has been eyeing a grand alliance of opposition parties, has been slamming the Delhi chief minister for the sit-in at Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal's office. The four chief ministers, who are in Delhi to attend a NITI Aayog meeting on Sunday, are expected to take up the matter with the prime minister. ""We came here to show our support to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. We demand that the prime minister interferes and takes necessary steps to solve the problem,"" Kumaraswamy said. ""I wanted to meet the Delhi chief minister but I was told, verbally, that permission will not be granted. Then four of us wrote to the LG for an appointment, but we were told that he is not there. We were not allowed,"" Banerjee said. Earlier, the four leaders met at Andhra Bhawan. The CMs met Kejriwal's wife, members of minister Satyendar Jain's family and several AAP leaders at the Delhi chief minister's home. “We want this problem to be solved. This has become a constitutional crisis. Ultimately, if this problem is not solved, the people will face issues,” Banerjee said. “If this is happening in the capital, then what will happen in other states? We will meet the prime minister tomorrow and request him to intervene and solve the problem,"" Banerjee said. The bureaucrats in Delhi are not meeting Delhi ministers as part of their protest against an alleged assault on Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash in February. They are demanding an apology from Kejriwal for the incident. At their joint press conference at Kejriwal's home, the CMs said they had come to show solidarity with the protest by the AAP chief. Pinarayi Vijayan said the Centre must take immediate steps to resolve the issue. ""We demand PM's intervention to solve this problem,"" he said. He said the situation had developed in this manner because of the attitude of the central government, which is “destroying” the federal system. The threat was not just to Delhi government but to the whole country, he said. Mamata Banerjee said there has been “no work” in Delhi for the last four months. “We want this issue to be sorted out as there is a constitutional crisis,"" she said. The people should not suffer due to a “political crisis” and their mandate should be respected, she added.

"BJP workers created a ruckus in Mysuru after party state president and chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa announced that his son Vijayendra will not be contesting from the Varuna constituency,  reported. Vijayendra supporters reportedly threw chairs at the convention on Monday, reminding people of what was witnessed across Congress district offices soon after the latter  Yeddyurappa's son was expected to go against Siddaramaiah's son Yathindra for the Varuna constituency in a contest between the offspring of Karnataka's two most popular leaders.   While it's far too early to tell if the BJP chickened out of the contest or if it is yet another poll strategy, Yeddyurappa's decision will surely  disappoint not only Vijayendra's supporters, but also several political analysts as well as Karnataka voters who will miss what was being touted as one of the biggest fights in the upcoming Assembly election. According to  , BJP is fielding a local worker from the constituency. Does the BJP's decision mean that Varuna is expected to be a cakewalk for Yathendra, who is making his poll debut? It may be too early to comment on that, but one should expect BJP to play the nepotism card against Congress while campaigning for their local worker. Varuna elected Siddaramiah in the 2013 Assembly polls, but during this election, the Karnataka chief minister decided to contest from Chamundeshwari and Badami, leaving Varuna for his son Yathindra.",FP Staff

" The Bawana fire tragedy triggered a political blame game in Delhi, which played out in tweets, videos and media statements, as the AAP and the BJP engaged in a war of words, while the Congress sought a judicial probe into the incident that claimed 17 lives. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal retweeted a video clip, that purportedly showed North Delhi Mayor Preety Agarwal murmuring something into the ears of her aides during her visit to the accident site last night, which has gone viral. Agarwal, however, claimed the video that was ""being made viral was ""fake"" and sought apology from the chief minister. ""Arvind Kejriwal by retweeting the video has resorted to dirty politics and he should apologise for that,"" she said and also posted on her Twitter handle. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari also backed the mayor. ""What could have been more worse than CM Arvind Kejriwal retweeting an untruthful video at a time when 17 people have died in a tragedy,"" he tweeted. On the tweet, he also claimed that the factory, where the fire occurred, was of the Delhi government and its ""licence was given through industry department."" Meanwhile, AAP Delhi unit chief and Labour Minister Gopal Rai held a press conference at the party office where he said the labour department will probe the case as well. ""The MCD issues licenses. The Delhi government issues licenses too. The investigation is underway, only the probe will reveal who was responsible for it - MCD or Delhi's govt's officers,"" Rai said. The blaze at the firecracker storage unit ripped through the structure killing 17 people on Saturday. The Delhi government on Saturday announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 1 lakh each to the injured. Senior BJP leader and New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi also held a press conference and defended the mayor claiming, ""She was only talking about the NDMC resolution abolishing factory licenses that was pending. The Delhi government is sitting over the resolution of 2015."" AAP's Delhi unit's chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj hit back at the BJP, saying the MCD (which is ruled by the BJP) is responsible for giving permission for constructions. ""It is quite audible that she is whispering in the ears of her aides that 'we will not speak on this because we have given license to this factory. This itself is extra-judicial confession of the MCD mayor'."" Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken visited the site today and demanded a judicial probe into it. He also questioned the role of the Delhi government agencies and said it should be probed. ""We demand a judicial probe. The role of Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) and the pollution department cannot be investigated in a magesterial inquiry,"" he told reporters at the site. On Saturday, a number of BJP leaders, including two Union ministers, and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had visited the site of the disaster. While AAP chief Kejriwal had said the truth about the functioning of the factory will come out only after the inquiry, which his government has ordered, the Delhi BJP had questioned the ""delay"" on part of the ruling party to reach out the affected families.

" Downplaying the BJP's victory in Tripura, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said the saffron party will never win West Bengal and Odisha, and dubbed it as ""a cockroach dreaming of becoming a peacock by putting on its feathers"". She said the result in Tripura was due to CPM's ""surrender"" and the ""failure"" of the Congress to agree to an alliance. The result could have been different had Rahul Gandhi agreed to an alliance with the Trinamool Congress and local hill parties, she said and claimed the poll results will not help the BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections in several states. ""There is nothing to rejoice in the win in a state having only about 26 lakh voters and two parliamentary seats with a difference of about only five percent votes,"" Banerjee said reacting to BJP's win in Tripura ending the 25 year-long Left regime. ""The CPM has done well in the poll. It is a difference of about five percent votes only. But the CPM in Tripura had never shown any seriousness to resist the saffron party in that state. I don't know why. We need to analyse this,"" Banerjee said. Despite the BJP's success in Tripura, ""it will not be possible at all to get through in West Bengal and Odisha. BJP will concede defeat in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In Gujarat, it was a moral defeat for them,"" she said. The 2019 Lok Sabha election would be a disaster for the saffron party and the party would fail to retain power, she claimed. On BJP targeting West Bengal and Odisha, Banerjee said ""sometimes a cockroach also wants to be a peacock and put on its feathers"". ""It will never happen and would forever remain a dream,"" she said. The Trinamool Congress chief said the BJP got 50 percent votes while, CPM got 45 percent. It was a difference of about five percent only. ""Had Rahul Gandhi accepted my proposal for an alliance among the Congress, the TMC and local hill parties, the situation would have been different in Tripura,"" she said. ""I had even recommended sharing of seats; Congress in 30 seats, TMC 14 and hill parties in 16 seats. But the Congress leadership turned down my offer and now you can see the results. ""The Congress has got just about 1.5 percent votes, which is a matter of shame,"" she said. Banerjee wondered why the CPM ""surrendered"" before the BJP. ""Was it in fear of being blackmailed and harassed by the central agencies?"" she asked. Banerjee also alleged that the BJP has used money power as well as the Central forces to win the elections.",PTI

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, 6 April accused the opposition of divisive politics and announced that BJP MPs will observe a fast on 12 April to protest the impasse in Parliament, for which he blamed the Congress. Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned sine die on Friday, with unabated protests virtually washing out a tumultuous Budget Session that saw a total of nearly 250 working hours wasted. Merely five of the 19 starred questions were replied to orally by Ministers in the Rajya Sabha, while 17 of the 580 such questions were answered in the Lok Sabha during the 29 sittings. “The prime minister said at a BJP parliamentary party meeting that the ruling party was doing an inclusive politics while the opposition was doing divisive and negative politics due to the saffron party's rising strength,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said. On a day when the BJP is celebrating its 38th foundation day, Modi said it has become the largest party due to people's blessings and tireless efforts of its workers and also paid tributes to many of its late leaders and workers. The Congress, in turn, gave a notice for breach of privilege against Kumar for misleading the Lok Sabha over continued disruptions by naming its top leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The notice was given by Congress leader KC Venugopal to the Lok Sabha Speaker today, in which he also accused the government of not being interested in running the House. He said as per the custom of the House, after a no confidence motion is moved, it is first taken up but it seems the government is not ready. ""The minister was deliberately misleading the house by naming the Congress leadership, thereby hiding the fact that it was the government who was actually stopping any kind of discussion on these issues including the no confidence motion,” Venugopal said in his notice. Do not make the Rajya Sabha a ""clog in the wheel"" of progress, Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu cautioned MPs before adjourning the proceedings of the Budget Session sine die, as the House lost nearly three- fourths of its time to disruptions and adjournments. During the second leg of the session which commenced on 29 January had 30 sittings in all. While it sat for 44 hours, the Upper House lost over 121 hours. Of the 419 starred questions listed, only five were replied to orally by the concerned ministers in the House. The Question Hour could not be taken up for 27 days ""due to pandemonium and interruptions in the House over one or the other issue"", Naidu said. The disruptions and adjournments were caused by protests over issues like special status to Andhra Pradesh, bank scams, demand for Cauvery water management board, vandalising of statues, review of the recent Supreme Court order on SC/ST Act and law and order situation in Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh. The proceedings were literally washed out in the post- recess session which started on March 5. ""I am pained to note that it turned out to be an eminently forgettable one on account of utter disregard of the mandate of this important parliamentary institution and its responsibilities and missed opportunities,"" Naidu said in his concluding address to the 245th session of Rajya Sabha. He noted that there was a ""total breakdown"" in communication among various sections of the House that was ""at the root of the prolonged stalemate that ruined the session."" ""This is not good for our parliamentary democracy of which our country has come to acquire a pride of place,"" he said, adding ""we are all losers.

Legislative Assembly polls in Telangana would be held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. ""Recently, a meeting was held in Delhi under the leadership of president Amit Shah  . He focused on Telangana. He clearly told that now elections are over in the states which are bound to take place.

More recently, during the World Economic Summit in Davos, Modi announced the ""improvement"" in rankings, adding that they proved that ""India was open for doing business"". However, according to CDG, the rankings tell a different story. India's ranking can simply be attributed to the addition of new countries to the list, i.e the sample size, the report said.

The difference reportedly does not come from a particular index, as scores from both the methods are ""not very different"".

"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will organise a 'Vikas Yatra' from Sunday, 11 February, onwards, in every constituency in Delhi, highlighting the ""good work"" done by the Kejriwal government and to mark its three years in power, Delhi’s Labour Minister Gopal Rai said on Friday. Party functionaries, AAP ministers and its lawmakers will take part in the 'yatra' to popularise their government's work, a move that comes at a time when the party is looking at possible bypolls after the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs. The AAP government completes three years in power on 14 February Rai stated that in the second phase of the ‘yatra’, party functionaries, especially booth in-charges, will meet residents of their areas and share information about the work done by the Delhi government. The AAP government has not only provided round-the-clock electricity, but has also dramatically reduced electricity charges, claimed Rai, adding that the rate for low consumption of below 400 units of electricity have been halved. By providing free water for those whose consumption is less than 20,000 litres the government has not only made water free for the poor, but also reduced water consumption, he said.

"The petition filed in the Supreme Court by Central Bureau of Investigation official Alok Verma on Wednesday said that the investigating agency’s autonomy was being compromised as “certain investigations into high functionaries do not take the direction that may be desirable to the government”. Verma had   the court on Wednesday morning, hours after the government   from his position as the CBI director and named M Nageshwar Rao the interim director. The court said it would hear Verma’s plea on Friday. Verma urged the top court to insulate the agency from governmental interference. “Not all influence that is exerted by the political government would be found explicitly or in writing,” he said in his petition. “More often than not it is tacit and requires considerable courage to withstand.”  Verma told the court that decision of the Department of Personnel and Training and the Central Vigilance Commission to divest him of his powers overnight was “patently illegal”. The government’s order   both Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana on leave was issued late on Tuesday. The two officers have been locked in a tussle and have accused each other of accepting bribes. The CBI chief urged the court to quash the order, claiming it was arbitrary and issued without following the due process of law. He also accused Asthana of obstructing investigations, some “very sensitive cases including those monitored by the court”. Verma noted that he had express reservations against Asthana’s appointment as special director last year but he was appointed despite pending cases against him. However, the CBI chief did not name the cases, saying they were “extremely sensitive”. He said he “shall however furnish the same” to the court, which will hear his petition on Friday.",Scroll Staff

" Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday slammed Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala for subverting the Constitution by inviting the BJP to form the government in the southern state. Labelling Vala an RSS Governor, the chief minister said democratic polity of India had been massacred to serve the desire and will of Vala's political masters in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""It was shocking the way the governor had given time to the BJP to break the Opposition and resort to horsetrading. (But) What else do you expect from an RSS governor,"" he told the media. He described the entire episode as ""unfortunate"", and said the developments in the last 24 hours were extremely dangerous for the country. ""We do not want India to become like Pakistan, where democracy is subverted by dictators and the army every step of the way,"" he said. Citing the examples of Goa and Manipur where governments were formed by majority post-poll alliances due to hung verdicts, Singh said the entire nation wanted an answer from the Karnataka governor. The governor should have called the parties with majority support to form the government and take the floor test immediately, instead of handing over the mantle to the minority party and giving them 15 days to make and break permutations and combinations through horsetrading, he added. The chief minister expressed hope that the Supreme Court would uphold the Constitutional principles and save the country's democratic structure from being crushed by fissiparous forces. Earlier, in a strongly-worded tweet, the chief minister wrote: ""Democracy has been brazenly manipulated, mutilated and massacred in Karnataka. It does not augur well for the future of India.

" The Supreme Court on Friday said the Unique Identification Authority of India’s proposal to hire a social media agency to monitor social media platforms was contrary to its earlier submissions. The UIDAI is the government agency which runs the Aadhaar scheme, A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud also asked attorney general K.K. Venugopal to assist it in the hearing of the plea on the issue filed by Mohua Moitra, an MLA of the Trinamool Congress. “It (monitoring) is directly against the submissions made by the UIDAI during the hearing of the Aadhaar matters,” the bench said, adding that what the UIDAI was proposing was contrary to “what it had argued while seeking validity of Aadhaar”. The UIDAI, during the hearing of a clutch of petitions challenging the validity of the Aadhaar scheme, had told the apex court that it did not want to monitor the online activities of citizens holding Aadhaar cards. Moitra’s plea said the UIDAI, as per its bid document, was seeking to hire a social media agency that will employ ‘online reputation management’ and ‘social listening’ tools to monitor and influence conversations related to Aadhaar on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. She had alleged that the move of hiring a social media monitoring agency was aimed at “mounting surveillance on social media platforms”. “Such action of the government violates her right of privacy. The scope of work of the Social Media Agency intended to be selected through the impugned request for proposal (RFP) is in the teeth of the judgment laid down by this Court in K S Puttaswamy case, wherein a bench of nine judges of this court recognised privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution,” the plea said. The petition claimed that the aim of employment of a “Social Listening Tool” by the social media agency of the UIDAI in accordance with the RFP on the pretext of raising awareness about Aadhaar is nothing but an attempt to “overreach the jurisdiction” of the apex court. “Despite the fact that the constitutional validity of various aspects of Aadhaar is under challenge before this court in a batch of petitions and judgment has been reserved by a constitution bench of this court in the matter, the respondents (Centre, UIDAI) have issued the RFP to identify ‘top detractors’ and ‘neutralise negative sentiments’ in relation to Aadhaar. It is therefore clear that the respondents have no respect or regard for proceedings before this court,” the petition said. The legislator alleged that the haste with which the RFP was being pushed through with the bids scheduled to be opened less than two weeks after the publication of the RFP itself demonstrated the mala fides of the Centre and the UIDAI. The plea said that weekly and monthly reports are to be prepared by the social media agency, indicating the most discussed topics, top detractors, top influencers and the net sentiment related to Aadhaar. “The entire surveillance architecture is to be placed in the hands of private persons employed on a contract basis who will be on the rolls of the service provider who emerges successful in the tender process. “While surveillance by agents of the state is itself violative of the right to privacy, in this case, the privacy of the citizens of this country is sought to be placed at the mercy of non-state actors which reeks of manifest arbitrariness,” the plea alleged. Earlier, the Centre had told the apex court that it will undertake a complete review of social media policy and withdraw its notification proposing a social media hub for the information and broadcasting (I&B) ministry. The decision had then led to the disposal of an earlier plea against the hub filed by Moitra against the notification of the I&B Ministry.",PTI

Although the BJP still stands first in the ABP-CSDS survey, a noticeable decline in its vote share and seat share is reflected in the survey numbers. The Congress party’s poll performance, though better from the last Assembly elections where it was at 36.38 percent and was able to secure only 58 seats, it still failed to gather majority in the survey. However, the BJP's vote share is expected to increase after Prime Minister Modi's campaign visit in the state which is supposed to take place after 15 November. It will be the BJP’s fourth consecutive win in the state if the party manages to form a majority, but the party has been struggling with the issue of anti incumbency evident to the voters.

": Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh expressed confidence that all ""like-minded parties"" in the Opposition which have the best interest of the nation at heart will support Congress chief Rahul Gandhi as the leader of an united alliance against the BJP-led NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Singh also said the Congress party, under the leadership of Rahul, will return to power in 2019 as the people are ""completely disillusioned"" with the BJP and want a ""positive change"". Singh, who is in Israel on a five-day visit, said India needed a young and dynamic leader to bring it out of the current mess and put it back on the global map. ""Rahul has all the qualities needed to be a great prime minister and he is the perfect man to lead the country, as I have always maintained,"" Singh told   in an interview when asked if he really feels Rahul is the right man for the job of running the country. Singh is heading a high-level delegation to Israel to strengthen Punjab's cooperation with it in the fields of agriculture, horticulture, dairy farming and waste water management, besides trying to attract investments in the state. Singh said the people are tired of ""misgovernance"" by the BJP.  ""The people are completely disillusioned with the BJP and want a positive change,"" he said.  ""The escalating prices of diesel and petrol, the economic situation faced by the country just see the way the rupee is going viz a viz the dollar, the polarisation triggered by the BJP, the widespread unemployment, the way many of the ministers at the Centre are functioning – the people can see all that, and are sick and tired of it. ""The time is up for the BJP. The Congress, under Rahul, is ready to take the reins of the country and bring it back on the path of progress and prosperity,"" Singh said. He said the entire Congress party is currently in election mode. ""All of us, including me, are ready to put all our might into ensuring that the party wins each one of them,"" he said. When asked whether opposition parties would be able to accept Rahul as the leader of a united alliance against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, Singh said all like-minded parties which have the best interests of the nation at heart will embrace him warmly as their leader. ""Other opposition parties know that the Congress is the only party that can lead an effective campaign against the BJP, and they also know that Rahul is more than capable to leading the united opposition. As I have said earlier, it is important to have the right kind of alliances at this juncture if we are to save the nation from the misgovernance of the BJP and its allies,"" he said. 
Singh expressed confidence that the Congress would win each of the states going to polls, referring to the assembly electons in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram and Chhattisgarh. Asked whether he would form an alliance with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab for the 2019 elections if there is a national alliance of the Congress with them, Singh said the Congress in Punjab will sweep the election on its own and does not need allies. ""We have also conveyed this to the Congress high command. But at the same time, we have told them that the final decision rests with them, which they would need to take keeping all exigencies in mind,"" he said.",Press Trust of India
"Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that his government will push ahead with plans to seize control of charities run by Hafiz Saeed. India has claimed that Saeed was the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.  Abbasi made the statement during an interview to   on Monday, days after the United States   its demand to Pakistan to   the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief. “Yes, the government will take over the charities which are sanctioned and not allowed to operate,” Abbasi said, adding that the military too was on board. “Everybody is on board, everybody is on the same page, everybody is committed to implementation of UN sanctions.” The news agency had last month reported on the government’s directions to federal and provincial departments to implement the sanctions against two charities – the Jamaat-ud-Dawa and the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, both of which the US has labelled “terrorist fronts” for the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba – and financial assets owned by Saeed.  The order came after the Financial Action Task Force, an international organisation that combats money laundering and terrorist financing, warned Islamabad that it faces inclusion on a watch list for failing to crack down on financing terrorism.

"Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath ridiculed Saturday the Opposition unity efforts ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, saying non-BJP parties were ganging up to create political instability in the country, a charge refuted by the Congress. ""The Opposition is worried that the BJP is gaining from strength to strength. They are opposed to development and have been ganging up to join hands with the only aim to take on the saffron party,"" the BJP leader said at an event by a media house. The chief minister said the people were hopeful that a grand Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya in the state and ""Lord Ram will decide its date"". Slamming the Opposition parties, the chief minister said, ""Their only aim is to create political instability in the country so that they can fish in troubled waters."" His comments at the  came against the backdrop of efforts to stitch an alliance among the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress in Uttar Pradesh with an eye on the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. ""The Opposition is against development and its only target is to dislodge the BJP from power,"" he said. Adityanath sought to poke fun at the Opposition parties, saying they were not clear as to who will lead the alliance. ""They cannot project any leader who can head the alliance,"" he said. ""A grand Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya. The people are very hopeful.   will decide its date. But, it will be built definitely,"" the saffron-clad chief minister said. The BJP will fight the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 on the plank of development, he said and exuded confidence the party will retain power under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""The BJP will again come to power at the Centre and under the able leadership of the prime minister, we will put up a grand show in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,"" Adityanath said. He was responding to a specific question about whether his party would repeat its performance in 2014 when it bagged 73 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state along with its alliance partners. The 46-year-old monk-turned-politician said the party does not believe in playing the caste card for the sake of votes and it will go to the polls on the development plank. ""The BJP does not play the caste card,"" he said. ""We believe in development and welfare of the people without any discrimination,"" he said. On the police encounters in the state, he said that the authorities are trying their best to instil confidence in the minds of the people that lawbreakers would not be allowed to go scot-free. ""At the same time, we have warned the police that there should not be any fake encounters. If they misuse power, action will be taken against them,"" he said. The chief minister, who assumed power last year after his party scored a landslide victory in the 2017 Assembly polls, slammed the previous Samajwadi Party dispensation saying, ""People voted against the SP as they came to realise the misdeeds of the Akhilesh Yadav government."" However, UPCC chief Raj Babbar, who was the next guest at the meet, refuted Adityanath's remarks over his remarks on the Opposition unity. ""The unity among the Opposition parties is to save the country from the BJP's misrule,"" he said. Babbar said that the unity efforts were in the context of Uttar Pradesh, which sends the highest number of 80 members to the Lok Sabha. ""This is Lok Sabha election and national leaders will take a call,"" he said. The actor-turned-politician said the efforts to strike unity among non-BJP parties were not directed against any individual. ""The sole purpose is to save the country from the BJP's misrule,"" he said. To a specific question as to who will head the alliance, Babbar said the issue will crop up at a later stage. ""The issue will be decided at a later stage. It is for the people to decide, the country will decide...,"" he said. ""But, one thing is for certain that if the Congress heads the alliance, it will be our party chief Rahul Gandhi who will head it,"" he added.",Press Trust of India
" CPI leader D Raja on Tuesday termed the political-tactical line of the CPM ""self-contradictory"" and said it was ""impossible"" to maximise rallying anti-BJP votes without any understanding with the largest Opposition party: the Congress. He said it was not possible for left and democratic forces to defeat the BJP all alone, without the Congress. ""The tactical line of the CPM is self-contradictory. If they want to maximise the pooling of anti-BJP votes without any understanding with the Congress, that is not possible. How can they say that they want to defeat the BJP but not have any understanding with the largest opposition party Congress,"" Raja told  . The CPM in its draft political resolution, released on Tuesday, has said that the main task of the party will be to defeat the BJP and its allies by rallying all secular and democratic forces, but it has to be done without having any understanding or political alliance with the Congress party. ""If they can cooperate with the Congress inside and outside Parliament, it means the Left is having an understanding with the Congress against the BJP,"" he said. Raja said that in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where the Congress is the main force to defeat the BJP, left and other democratic forces will have to have an understanding with the Congress. He also highlighted the fact that in the last assembly election in Bihar, the Left went all alone, but it was the RJD-JD(U)-Congress alliance which defeated the BJP. The Left leader emphasised that the need of the hour is to have a state-specific tactical line and the CPI(M) should understand the political situation in the country. ""That is what we are pointing out. There can be difficulties in some states. But this can be addressed at that point of time keeping in mind the specific political situation prevailing in those states. The CPM should understand that there is need to chalk out state-specific electoral-tactical line,"" Raja said. The CPI leader said that keeping in mind the future of the country, the Left should try to have the broadest possible platform along with all democratic parties at the national level to defeat the BJP.

" The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will be compelled to go it alone if it does not get a ""respectable"" number of seats in the anti-BJP alliance that is shaping up before the Lok Sabha 2019 polls, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati said Sunday. The BSP chief also said that instances of mob lynching in the name of cow protection were a ""blot on democracy"" and accused BJP governments in various states of being indifferent to the problem. At a press conference, held for the first time in her new accommodation in Lucknow after she was forced to vacate her sprawling bungalow on Supreme Court orders, Mayawati made clear her party might be compelled to go it alone if it does not get a ""respectable number"" of seats in the anti-BJP alliance. ""Our party is not against the alliance, but our stand is very clear that we will ally with a political party only if we get a respectable share of seats. Otherwise, our party feels it better to contest the elections alone,"" she said. On the Lok Sabha 2019 elections and the upcoming Assembly elections in certain states, Mayawati said, the effort of the Opposition parties will be to stop the BJP from coming to power at any cost. Maywati targeted the BJP claiming that its governments in the Centre and states had ""worsened"" the condition of the people by showing them false dreams.  ""These governments have done no good to people barring a few industrialists,"" she alleged adding that ""both the NDA and the previous UPA governments were equally responsible for shielding the corrupt"". Mayawati also said the ""increasing tendency"" of mobs indulging in lynching in the name of cow protection in the ""BJP-ruled states"" was a blot on democracy. Yet the governments (in these states) are exercising laxity and are being indifferent to it, she claimed. ""These activities of the BJP governments against the Dalits, Tribals, backwards, Muslims and Christians are going on from their inception and are a result of the party's intention to go against the Constitution...This has been part of the basic policy of the BJP, which has assumed alarming proportions after they came to power,"" she alleged. Continuing her attack on the BJP, Mayawati claimed that the party after forming the government was trying to crush the democratic movements and resorting to ""terror tactics"" in this regard. ""After the 2 April 'Bharat Bandh' called by Dalit organisations, atrocities are going on,"" she alleged. Accusing the BJP of resorting to ""diversionary tactics"" as Lok Sabha elections were approaching, Mayawati said the saffron party was not leaving any stone unturned to ""derive advantage from the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee"". ""As the Lok Sabha elections and Assembly elections are approaching in certain states, the BJP is resorting to different tactics to hide its failures and is making lucrative announcements. In this matter, they (BJP) are not leaving any stone unturned to derive advantage from the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They never followed his footsteps, when he was alive,"" she alleged. ""If Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP followed the footsteps of Vajpayee and ran the government accordingly, there would not have been religious frenzy and communal incidents. Nor there would have been the rule of mobocracy,"" she claimed. ""People know the campaign undertaken by the BJP and RSS in the name of Vajpayee is an attempt to hide failures,"" she said continuing her attack. ""The BJP will not get any benefit from this,"" she added. ""The people of the country now understand that none of the election promises made in Lok Sabha 2014 elections was fulfilled,""  she said. Mayawati also alleged that the Centre was not able to come clean on the Rafale deal. Referring to demonetisation, Mayawati said it was done in an unplanned manner leading to a ""financial emergency"". The BJP government should now at least tender an apology over the ""national tragedy"", she said. On the possibility of misuse of SC/ST Act, Mayawati said, ""The BSP is of the view that if the current state governments follow the 'Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay' policy of her party, there will be no misuse of this law.""",Press Trust of India

" Claiming that the RLSP has gained significantly in strength in Bihar, Union minister Upendra Kushwaha on Friday demanded that his party be allotted more than three seats in the state by the NDA to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Bihar has 40 Lok Sabha seats, of which Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party had contested and won three seats in the 2014 general election. ""My party had contested three Lok Sabha seats in 2014 but now this party's strength and base have increased... Our party should be given more than three seats after making a neutral assessment of its strength,"" Mr Kushwaha told reporters at his party office in Patna. Kushwaha, the Union minister of state for human resource development, said there is little doubt the RLSP has gained strength but how much could be a matter of debate. Replying to a query, Kushwaha admitted that he had raised the demand for more number of seats with BJP general secretary and Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav. If need be, he added, he would also speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the matter. Kushwaha said the seat-sharing issue between NDA partners in Bihar - BJP, JD(U), RLSP and LJP - has not been finalised, or else it would have been announced. The BJP had won 22 seats in Bihar in the 2014 election, while Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP had contested seven seats and won six. On 26 October, BJP chief Amit Shah had announced that the BJP and the JD(U) would contest an equal number of seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Bihar. Kushwaha asserted his alliance with the BJP and LJP was intact but expressed displeasure over Chief Minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar's statement apparently directed at him. He said Kumar should retract the statement or explain what he actually meant. On the seat-sharing issue with particular reference to Kushwaha's RLSP, Kumar had told a television channel on 3 November, ""Do not take the debate to such a low level"". Kushwaha said he felt the remark was laden with casteist overtones. ""I am extremely hurt and pained by Nitish Kumar's statement in which he referred to me as ' '. The kind of language Kumar has used for me is intolerable. Nitish Kumar should withdraw his statement,"" Kushwaha said.

" Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan has appealed to CPM leader Prakash Karat to reconsider his resolution of ""no alliance"" with the party in the larger interest of the country ahead of the Left party's general session in April. Appealing to Karat, the CPM politburo member, to do a rethink on his resolution of ""no alliance and no cooperation"" with the Congress, Chavan said ""any prick lines with the Congress can always be sorted out"". In a move aimed at consolidating anti-BJP parties ahead of 2019 polls, Chavan also asked Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh president and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar to drop his anti-Congress pitch while dubbing him as an ""erudite leader of the Dalits after BR Ambedkar"". In a politically significant development, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury's draft resolution proposing an alliance with the Congress was defeated in voting during the party's central committee meeting last month. In a blog, Chavan said it was ""flummoxing "" that when comrade Yechury and comrade Raja walked shoulder to shoulder with other opposition leaders in the ""save the Constitution"" march, the Congress became ""untouchable"" for comrade Karat at this critical juncture. Chavan was referring to the march which was held in south Mumbai on 26 January and was attended by Left leaders, JD(U) rebel Sharad Yadav, NC's Omar Abdullah, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and others. ""I can only pray that that he (Karat) does a rethink before his party's general session in April, where his resolution will be ratified or rejected, in the larger interest of the country. Any prick lines with the Congress can always be sorted out,"" the former chief minister said. He also took an apparent jibe at Ramdas Athawale, the Union minister of state for social justice in the NDA government. ""Prakash Ambedkar is emerging as an erudite leader of the Dalits after Babasaheb Ambedkar. He is astute, educated, sophisticated and presentable. ""It is these qualities that make him stand apart from those who claim to be champions of the Dalit cause but have fallen for allurement and largesse of BJP,"" Chavan said. Athawale's RPI (A) has the largest following among the Dalits in Maharashtra who are divided in various factions. ""I have personally witnessed how they lost their trustworthiness and are being hated by the Dalit community. This is the time when Prakashji needs as many friends as 
possible across the political spectrum to consolidate his position,"" Chavan said. He also showered praises on Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of BR Ambedkar, but expressed dissatisfaction over his decision of staying away from the march. He said the march was not the occasion to display the ""discomfort"" Prakash Ambedkar had with certain leaders. ""It (the march) was an expression of disenchantment with current rulers and solidarity with the Constitution. Why shy away from shaking hands with the Congress to begin with,"" he said. ""I'm sure Prakash Karat and Prakash Ambedkar are both bright enough to distinguish who the real enemy is and how any rigid stance may eventually help the monster grow,"" the Nanded MP said. Today, we are witnessing what can be described as butchering of innocent people on the false notions of nationalism, he alleged. ""Disastrous economic policies and immature financial decisions have wrecked havoc on the life of workers farmers and lower middle class,"" Chavan said. In a bid to reach larger constituency, Chavan said the ""religious supremacy"" was thrust upon the country. He alleged that the unchecked arrogance of the current dispensation had reached its peak and religious supremacy was being thrust upon the country. Minorities and Dalits were being treated as secondary citizens and even ministers were saying that they had assumed power to alter India's secular constitution, Chavan said.

"A US judge has temporarily blocked the online publication of blueprints for 3D-printed firearms, in a last-ditch effort to stop a settlement President Donald Trump's administration had reached with the company releasing the digital documents. Eight states and the District of Columbia, which houses the capital Washington, had filed a lawsuit against the federal government, calling its settlement with Texas-based Defense Distributed ""arbitrary and capricious"". The Trump administration had settled a five-year legal fight by permitting the company to publish its website Defcad -- which founder Cody Wilson envisioned as a WikiLeaks for homemade firearms called ""ghost guns"". Those weapons can be manufactured using 3D printers or personal steel mills, and lack traceable serial numbers. At least one of the guns can also be made from plastic, which is virtually invisible to metal detectors. US District Judge Robert Lasnik in Seattle, Washington granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order blocking the release of the digital plans, and scheduled a hearing for 10 August. In a written statement, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, one of plaintiffs, called the ruling ""a major victory for common sense and public safety."" As uproar mounted on 31 July, the White House expressed skepticism over the legality of Wilson's efforts, even though the administration had green-lighted the project. Trump weighed in on Twitter, revealing that he had spoken to America's main pro-gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, about the topic. ""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public,"" the president said. ""Already spoke to NRA, doesn't seem to make much sense!"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley expanded on the president's comments on 31 July night, telling reporters: ""It is currently illegal to own or make a wholly plastic gun of any kind -- including those made on a 3D printer. The administration supports this nearly two-decade old law."" Twenty-three Democratic senators later introduced a bill designed to block the publication of 3D printable firearm blueprints. Wilson remained defiant and vowed to fight in court. He told  magazine that he is facing legal action from ""at least 21 state attorneys general"" who have cited a risk to public safety. ""I intend to litigate,"" he told the magazine. ""Americans have the unquestionable right to share this information."" The self-proclaimed ""crypto-anarchist"" also made the digital blueprints available online earlier than the 1 August launch date he had previously announced. News agency AFP was able to download two files from the website on 31 July, though it had some technical glitches and was difficult to access. Cody Wilson’s legal team has argued that any move to prevent the distribution of the blueprints would run counter to the ""foundational principles of free speech"". But federal courts have disagreed. Before the settlement with the Trump administration, Wilson had lost in both district and appellate court. The US Supreme Court had declined to take up his case. Politicians, gun control advocates and law enforcement had expressed concerns that Defcad's files would allow anyone -- from a teen to a convicted felon -- to make dangerous weapons. But while Wilson has somehow become the public face of homemade weapons technology, the phenomenon of ""ghost guns"" is bigger than his website alone. Earlier in July, Los Angeles police showcased an arsenal of such weapons seized from gang members during a six-month undercover operation. Over the last five years, Wilson's Defense Distributed has grown to 15 employees inside a non-descript warehouse in the Texas state capital Austin. They have created a plastic 3D-printable handgun called the ""Liberator,"" a machine called the ""Ghost Gunner"" with which homemade metal gun parts can be constructed, and amassed other digital gun files. Jonathan Lowy of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence told AFP that if Wilson's website is ultimately allowed to publish, the consequences could be even greater outside of the US. ""It's certainly a huge international problem, particularly given that many other countries have much stronger gun laws than in America,"" Lowy said. ""So, in those countries, there are many people who shouldn't have guns and could not get them unless they can get their hands on a 3D-printed gun."" (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" The Congress on Friday hit back at the BJP for its statement that the opposition party was trying to create a ""partition-like situation"" in the country, saying that it was the saffron party that was seeking to polarise people and diverting attention from ""real issues"". In a sharp attack on the Congress, senior BJP leader and Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman had asked Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to clarify his remarks reported in an Urdu daily that his party was a Muslim party and that he was on a course correction path. The Congress has dismissed the media report as a ""rumour"" and asserted that it was a party of 132 crore Indians. Taking on Sitharaman, Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev said it was expected that with just days to go for the Monsoon Session, the Defence Minister would take up issues which are ""to create unnecessary controversy and move away from real issues"". ""I request Nirmala Sitharamanji that you have not bothered to answer the nation about the Rs 58,000 crore Rafale deal which is the biggest scam. If you have the courage in this monsoon session please make a suo moto statement and reply to the nation about how the defence ministry has conducted the biggest scam under your nose,"" Dev said. The Defence Minister ""is trying to create tensions between people of different religions,"" the Congress MP said on Friday. The Congress as a party has fought for the freedom of India, it has stood by the Constitution and is a party that is inclusive, she asserted. Raking up the issue of 2002 Gujarat riots, the Congress spokesperson accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of making repeated attempts to polarise people. ""We request you to not increase division through your press meets, do not go towards polarisation because that is the only thing the prime minister falls back on before every election. ""This has never been the politics of the Congress. Get ready for some real answers in the coming Monsoon session,"" she said. If the peace is shattered in the country, the government is responsible and not the opposition, she added. ""The news of Tharoor's comments, the media report on Rahul are being twisted in the media. The prime minister has made repeated attempts to polarise. What were his intentions? Nirmala Sitharaman must answer this and then question the Congress. ""Till today the biggest black mark in the history of India has been the riots of Gujarat and Prime Minister Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat at that time and still he has not taken moral responsibility for that,"" Dev said. Sitharaman, in her remarks, had said that the Congress chief must come out and tell very clearly what he meant when he said that the Congress was a Muslim party. She also said the opposition party was trying to create a ""partition like situation"" in the country, and it would be solely responsible if any disharmony plays out between now and 2019. Earlier in the morning, Congress' communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala, responding to a question on the Urdu media report, said when governance fails, rumours take precedence. ""When the government is on the path of lying, then rumours become the main policy of the government,"" he said. No matter how much they try and spread rumours, Prime Minister ""Modi's supporters cannot hide his misrule"", he said. Noting that the history of the Indian national movement and the history of the Congress are well documented, Surjewala said the Congress is a party of 132 crore Indians, and will remain so forever.

"Aaditya Thackeray, the son of Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, was on Tuesday elevated as a party ""neta"" (leader) at its national executive meeting held. With the new post, the 27-year-old Thackeray junior, who already heads Yuva Sena, will now be a part of the Sena's core team. At the national executive meeting, the Sena conducted the internal polls as per the guidelines of the Election Commission of India to elect the party president and other functionaries on the day which happens to be the birth anniversary of party founder (late) Bal Thackeray. In the Sena hierarchy, the posts of ""netas"" (leaders) and ""upnetas"" (deputy leaders) are second in importance after the post of party president. On the occasion, the Sena also passed a resolution to elevate Uddhav Thackeray's PA Milind Narvekar as a party secretary. Narvekar, who maintains a low profile, has often played a crucial role during the Sena's discussion with its ally BJP. ""I still remember, when the Sena conducted its first Dussehra rally in 1966, I, as a five-year-old, sat on my mother's lap. I sat listening to the fiery speech given by my father and other leaders. We have a responsibility on our shoulders that we have to take forward,"" the Thackeray senior said while addressing a gathering of the Sena leaders. Seeking to preempt any criticism arising out from the move to elevate his son, Uddhav said Bal Thackeray had ""clearly explained the difference between family politics and the family tradition of working for the people"". ""Aaditya is the sixth generation of the Thackeray family....everybody has devoted his/her life for the well being of Maharashtra and its people,"" he said. Uddhav said nobody from his family will break the trust of people and the work for the people's welfare will continue. Besides Aaditya, state minister Eknath Shinde, Union minister Anant Geete and Lok Sabha MPs — Chandrakant Khaire and Anandrao Adsul — were elevated as ""netas"" or the party leaders. Sena will now have 13 ""netas"" with the five new additions. Diwakar Raote, Subhash Desai and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut are some of the prominent leaders who have been holding the post of netas. Vithalrao Gaikwad and Raghunath Kuchik were elected as new ""upnetas"" or deputy leaders of the party.",PTI

" The Supreme Court on Friday modified a previous order providing for setting up of a committee to deal with complaints of dowry harassment, thereby restoring to the police the power to investigate a case filed under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code dealing with the issue. The top court had on April 23 reserved its verdict on a batch of pleas seeking revision of a 2017 judgment that had reduced the severity of the anti-dowry law on the offence of subjecting a married woman to cruelty by spouse and in-laws. “We have protected pre-arrest or anticipatory bail provision in dowry harassment cases,” said a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra and comprising justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud. The apex court, while modifying the verdict given by its two-judge bench, said there is no scope for courts for constitutionally filling up gaps in penal law. “There should be gender justice for women as dowry has a chilling effect on marriage on the one hand. On the other hand, there is right to life and personal liberty of the man,” the bench said while reserving its verdict. A two-judge bench of the apex court had in July last year voiced concern over “abuse” of section 498A (subjecting a married woman to cruelty) and passed a slew of directions, including that no arrest should “normally be effected” without verifying allegations as violation of human rights of innocents could not be brushed aside. The bench was hearing a plea filed by Nyayadhar, an NGO formed by a group of women advocates of Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district, seeking sharpness in section 498A, claiming that the otherwise “helpful instrument” in the hands of victim women has become “valueless”.",PTI
": The BJP has alleged the Shiv Sena roped in some criminals to distribute money to voters ahead of the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll scheduled for Monday, and said it would complain about it to the Election Commission. ""The BJP is going to lodge a complaint with the Election Commission that the Sena has brought 1,000 people from (neighbouring) Thane, Mumbai and Kalyan who are staying illegally in Palghar even after the campaigning is over, and they are distributing money (to voters),"" BJP leader Ravindra Chavan told  . ""These people, who are distributing money, also include criminals,"" Chavan, who is the Minister of State for Medical Education, alleged. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut hit back saying the BJP was levelling such charges as it was scared of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party. ""Talking about the Sena distributing money does not befit the BJP. The Shiv Sena is a party of the common man and our workers are our strength. It is the people who give our leaders food to eat and water to drink when we go for campaigning,"" Raut said. He alleged that the BJP was rather ""teaching"" corrupt practices to its young party workers by making them indulge in distributing money and alcohol. ""They are free to approach the EC as and when they wish to. However, the truth is that they are scared of us and hence, using these tactics,"" Raut said. The BJP and the Shiv Sena, the allies at the Centre and in Maharashtra, had a bitter face-off during the campaigning for the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll with both the parties trading charges against each other.

"In an unprecedented turn of events, irate Opposition members are sitting in the Rajya Sabha even after adjournment. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the day as ruckus in both Houses continued. The Lok Sabha was adjourned till 12 pm after Opposition members began protesting loudly in the House. Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for the 15th day on Friday as the stalemate between the Opposition and the government continued for the third week of the second leg of the budget session with ruckus prevailing unabated. While the Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the day in less than 20 minutes after it assembled on Friday morning, the Lok Sabha was first adjourned till noon and then for the day after laying of the listed papers. The Lower House also did not take up the no-confidence motion against the government due to the noisy protests. It has been a week since the motion has not been taken up due to the unruly scenes. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan had last Friday announced that she had received two notices for the motion but was unable to start the process due to the disruptions. However, before they were adjourned on Friday, both the Houses paid glowing tributes to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, who were hanged on this day 87 years ago by the British rulers. The Rajya Sabha could not transact any business on Friday, as Opposition parties continued to create ruckus, forcing the adjournment of proceedings. Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the proceedings for the day but not before expressing anguish over the House not functioning since it met on 5 March when the second part of the budget session started. Naidu said past disruptions should not be cited to justify the ""present wrong"" and expressed hope that the government will take the Opposition into confidence to ensure that the House functions next week. He said it was distressing that the Rajya Sabha has not discharged its mandate for three weeks. ""People of the country have been let down."" Andhra parties, including the TDP, and KVP Ramachandra Rao of the Congress trooped into the Well shouting slogans for special status to the state, while Tamil Nadu parties — DMK and AIADMK — 
demanded setting up of the Cauvery management board for river water sharing between riparian states. Congress members too were in the Well, raising slogans that the government was against scheduled castes and tribes, in an apparent reference to the recent Supreme Court ruling diluting certain provisions of the Scheduled castes and tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Naidu said he could understand that MPs may resort to disruption for a couple of days to press their issues but ""persisting with it for three weeks has no justification"". Congress members countered this by blaming the government for the stalemate and alleged that it has not engaged with the opposition parties on these matters so far. The Chairman, however, went on to state that while some may cite past instances to justify the present impasse, the three-week long disruption had no justification. ""How long do you want to justify the present wrong, based on the past,"" he said. ""People of the country are aspiring for a change. Should the change not begin from Rajya Sabha."" He said people were asking why the House was not being adjourned sine die but added that this was not in his hands. ""I am pained, I am sad,"" he said, adding he would not like to hazard a guess about what will happen next week or ""if you are going to change for better...If you are not interested in running of this House, it is another matter."" When Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel read out the government agenda for next week, Naidu hoped the government will take the Opposition into confidence to ensure that the House functions. Naidu said he was willing to allow discussion on any issue the members wanted, but placards, demonstrations and slogan shouting was not justified. He then adjourned the proceedings till Monday. The Lok Sabha proceedings were also disrupted on Friday due to noisy protests by the AIADMK and TRS members, following which Speaker Sumitra Mahajan expressed her inability to take up the notices for no-confidence motion and later adjourned the proceedings for the day. She also announced a holiday for members on Monday on account of Ramnavami on Sunday as many of them had conveyed they would be busy in various related events and would find it difficult to join the House the next day. The House was adjourned till noon soon after it met at 11 am following noisy protests by members of the AIADMK and the TRS over the Cauvery and quota issues respectively. When it reassembled, the protests continued and Mahajan said she cannot not take up the notices for no-confidence motions as the House was not in order. The requisite head-count of members supporting the notices can be done only if they are in their seats, she added. At least 50 members need to support a no-confidence notice for the House to accept it and start a debate. The Speaker said the government had expressed its readiness for a discussion on it. The BJP-led NDA government enjoys a comfortable majority in the House. The Lok Sabha was then adjourned for the day as the protests continued. This is the third straight week that both the Houses were adjourned without undertaking any significant business, barring the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha. Earlier when the House met for the day, Mahajan paid tributes to Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev — who were hanged on 23 March, 1931 by the British. The House observed silence as a mark of respect to the martyrs. Before taking up the question hour, the Speaker urged members to maintain order but those from AIADMK and TRS trooped into the Well holding placards and raising slogans. Congress members too were on their feet protesting against the Supreme Court verdict on the SC/ST Act. It has been demanding that the Centre seek a review of the court order which diluted provisions related to immediate arrest in cases related to atrocities on scheduled castes and tribes.

"Mohammed Haris Nalapad, who is currently locked up in Parappana Agrahara Central Jail, seems to have learnt no lessons. He has now allegedly assaulted his own accomplice after an argument broke out between them inside the prison. Meanwhile, senior High Court advocate Shyam Sundar, who represented the victim, Vidvat, has approached Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar seeking protection after he heard someone say that “he will also get the same treatment.” According to the Parappana Agrahara officials, Nalapad and six of his associates were taken to jail on Wednesday evening after the court ordered 14 days judicial custody. They were given a big cell inside the jail where Mohammed and six others were accommodated. It is said that Mohammed and his associates did not sleep till midnight as they were discussing how the attack on Vidvat took a turn and developed into a major issue. The discussion is said to have devolved into an argument, and one of the accused, Mohammed Ashraf alias Abras, reportedly blamed Mohammed for landing them in jail with attempt to murder charges. A massive fire broke out on the sets of reality show Bigg Boss Kannada at the Innovative Film City in Bidadi early on Thursday, 22 February.

However, as he was not aware of fire services number, he began calling his seniors wasting much time, a fire official said. He called the fire station at 4.34 am. Around 11 fire tenders with a rescue vehicle rushed to the spot and it took three hours for them to bring the blaze under control. The blaze was completely put off only by 10.30 am, a senior fire official said.

" BJP president Amit Shah would address a rally in Mumbai on 6 April on the occasion of the party's 38th Foundation Day, which is seen as a formal launch of its campaign for the 2019 polls. Party workers from various parts of Maharashtra are expected to attend the event to be held at the MMRDA grounds in the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in suburban Bandra. Besides Shah, Union ministers hailing from Maharashtra and other BJP leaders will address the congregation to be held at 11:30 am, state unit president Raosaheb Danve said while addressing a press conference today. For the saffron party, the Mumbai venue has an emotional connect, as its first convention after formation of the party was held in the Maharashtra capital in 1980. ""The BJP intends to have one crore members in the state. We have a team of 25 youths comprising women, Dalits, OBCs and Adivasis for manning each booth in the state. There are 315 booths in each Assembly constituency. This takes the total number of booth workers in each constituency to 7500,"" said Danve. Maharashtra has 288 Assembly constituencies. Danve said arrangements have been made to bring the party workers to Mumbai in trains, buses and jeeps. Referring to the 1980 convention, Danve said a clarion call was then given for making Atal Bihari Vajpayee the next prime minister, which took some years to materialise. ""Vajpayee was elected prime minister thrice in later years. After the BJP's BKC rally in 2014 (which was addressed by the BJP's then prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi) power was changed in the country, similarly this upcoming mega rally will also enthuse party cadres with new energy and the impact would be seen nationwide,"" he said. To a question whether the rally can be viewed as the formal launch of the BJP's electoral campaign, Danve replied, ""Yes, you can say that"". To a question on whether the BJP's ally Shiv Sena or newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP Narayan Rane is invited for the rally, Danve replied in the negative saying it is the party function. ""Rane is an NDA ally and we are supporting him,"" he said. Rane, whose Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha is an ally of the NDA, was recently elected to Rajya Sabha on the BJP's support. On Sena's stand to not have any electoral truck with the BJP in the next Assembly and Lok Sabha elections, Danve evaded a direct reply. ""The BJP is constantly working to strengthen the organisation and the efforts would yield the party good results,"" he said. On the criticism by the Opposition parties that the BJP was holding a party rally at a time when farmers are in distress, the BJP leader said the state government has been tirelessly working to improve the life of farmers.

"The Delhi Assembly on Monday witnessed high drama after a BJP MLA used an ""objectionable"" word against a ruling AAP legislator during a discussion on water shortage in the national capital. Following the ruckus, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejrwial hit out at the BJP, accusing the saffron party of dividing India in the name of Hindus and Muslims. Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel later referred the matter of BJP legislator OP Sharma using an objectionable word against AAP's Amanatullah Khan to the House Privileges Committee. The action came after AAP legislators demanded action against the Viswas Nagar MLA of BJP. His remark, they said, was an ""insult of the House"".

"Three BJP-ruled states and Tamil Nadu will move the Supreme Court against its order on the SC/ST Act with the Centre maintaining that state governments are on board in seeking a recall of the verdict, days after violent protests by Dalit groups engulfed several parts of the country. Following a nudge from the top BJP brass, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh – all of whom had reportedly taken steps to implement the verdict – have revoked their decision and decided to join the Centre in filing review pleas. Official sources also said the Centre is keeping ready an ordinance to annul the order of the court, depending on the outcome of its petition. The court on 20 March had laid down guidelines to prevent the alleged misuse of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Dalit groups have, however, vehemently protested against the verdict, saying it dilutes the law and will lead to a rise in cases of atrocities against the scheduled castes and tribes. A 'Bharat Bandh' called by them on 2 April had turned violent, leading to deaths of at least 11 persons. While the Centre has already filed a review plea, a top BJP leader told reporters that the party's central leadership has spoken to the chief ministers of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where police chiefs were asked to implement the March 20 order, to keep in abeyance the decision and move the court with their review pleas. In Raipur, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh told reporters that his government is moving the Supreme Court against its order while it has also revoked a police department circular on the implementation of the verdict. Tamil Nadu government also announced that it will move the apex court. The decision was arrived at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister K Palaniswami with his cabinet colleagues, including his deputy O Panneerselvam, an official release said. Opposition parties have used the issue to attack the ruling BJP, which has been assiduously wooing Dalits under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and its president Amit Shah. Indicating that more states will move the apex court, home ministry officials said state governments are with the Centre on the issue of recalling the Supreme Court order. With the NDA government facing flak from the opposition over Dalit issues, Union minister and BJP ally Ram Vilas Paswan said the Modi dispensation will now push for reservation for Scheduled Castes and Tribes in promotion in government jobs and may bring an ordinance.

The Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram made the announcement after a meeting with police officials and representatives of Maratha organisations.

": There was no food scarcity in the state and no one from Tripura had crossed over to neighbouring Bangladesh in search of food, Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Debbarma has said, refuting claims of CPI(M) MP Jitendra Chaudhury earlier this month. It is a false and ""baseless allegation"" leveled by a CPI(M) leader, Debbarma told reporters on Wednesday. ""Those levelling allegations"" against the ruling government should introspect more about their actions. If anyone has any information about people crossing over to Bangladesh for food or job should provide the details to us,"" he said.

Rebutting the CPI(M) MP's allegations, Debbarma said the present government has so far generated four lakh more NREGA men-days in the current fiscal as compared to the same period in the last fiscal. ""A total of 10.34 lakh men-days were generated in the state up to May 2018 in the current financial year as against 6.49 lakh men-days generated over the same period last fiscal.

" The CBI director today told the Supreme Court that two chargesheets have been filed in cases of alleged Manipur fake encounters by the army, Assam Rifles and state police, and five more final reports will be filed in separate cases by August 31. CBI director Alok Kumar Verma had been summoned by the apex court which was unhappy over the “unduly long time” taken by the agency in probing the cases of alleged extra-judicial killings and fake encounters in Manipur. A bench of Justices M.B. Lokur and U.U. Lalit was told by the agency’s director that 14 persons have been chargesheeted for the offences of murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence related to the Manipur encounter cases. The agency also told the court that by August 31, five more final reports will be filed in separate encounter cases of Manipur and that probe in 20 more Manipur encounter cases will be completed by December end. The court, however, left it to the CBI director and SIT in-charge to take a call on whether those charge sheeted for the offence of murder in the encounter cases in Manipur need to be arrested or not. The court then posted the matter for further hearing on August 20. Terming the SIT probe as “snakes and ladders”, the top court had earlier expressed dissatisfaction over the progress made so far and said it would like to know from the CBI Director what steps must be taken to ensure that the investigation into the cases are completed early and final reports filed “as expeditiously as possible”.

" Six policemen were injured on Monday when the BJP and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers clashed at Usti in South 24 Parganas district over filing of nominations for next month's panchayat elections in West Bengal, the police said. Monday was the the last day for filing of nominations for the panchayat polls to be held on 1, 3 and 5 May. Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court refused to extend the last date for the filing of nominations for the rural polls, saying it could not interfere with the election process. The top court, however, granted liberty to all candidates to approach the West Bengal State Election Commission for appropriate relief. The BJP had on 6 March told the apex court that ""democracy is being murdered"" in West Bengal as the ruling TMC was engaged in large scale violence and not allowing its candidates to file nominations for the panchayat polls. The TMC leadership welcomed the apex court's ruling. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, however, said, ""If the TMC tries to unleash violence on the days of the polls, it will be paid back in the same coin. If they attack us with bombs and pistols, we won't greet them with a plate of sweets."" The BJP, the CPM and the Congress alleged that their candidates were attacked by TMC activists also at Baruipur, Diamond Harbour and Bhangar — all in South 24 Parganas district. In Baruipur, a woman candidate was beaten up while trying to file nomination for the rural polls. ADGP (law and order) Anuj Sharma told reporters in Kolkata that five people were arrested for the assault on the woman, and seven others were detained in connection with the incident at Usti. District police sources said six police personnel were injured while trying to stop the clash between workers of the TMC and the BJP, and one policeman suffered bullet injury in his left hand. The BJP alleged that their party workers were attacked by ""armed goons"" of the Trinamool when they were going to file nominations. In Birbhum district Zilla Parishad, the TMC won 41 of the 42 seats uncontested, an official of the District Panchayat and Rural Development said. There would be election only in Rajnagar seat where the BJP has filed nomination, he said. Ghosh alleged that the TMC has managed to make Birbhum opposition-less with the help of the musclemen and the police. ""We have no faith on the state police. Even our women candidates were beaten up and hundreds of our party workers were arrested,"" he said. Denying the BJP's charges, TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said the opposition parties did not have the organisation to fight the rural poll. ""Wherever they don't have people to contest the election, they are blaming the TMC for the violence,"" he said. Chatterjee, also a state minister, accused the opposition parties of trying to destabilise the state and alleged that the BJP was trying to divide the people on communal line. By moving the courts, the opposition parties were trying to put pressure on the State Election Commission (SEC) that is conducting the panchayat polls, he said. Chatterjee who met the state election commissioner during the day, said the commission should not bow down to any pressure. The ADGP (law and order) said armed police would be deployed in all the polling booths during the three-tier panchayat election next month. Asserting that the police were playing a ""proactive role"" in ensuring free and fair polls, he said 2,000 preventive arrests have been made since yesterday and 256 were arrested in specific cases. Ten arms and two bombs were recovered from separate places in the state, he said, adding that checking at various points were being strengthened.",PTI

"Lakhs of ASHA (accredited social health activists) and anganwadi workers spread across in rural areas of the country had so far lived an unsung life. This all-woman workforce that is engaged in the critical task of rural child healthcare, prenatal care and nutrition programmes for pregnant women in the hinterland has hardly ever received the recognition it deserves. Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly engaged with over 28 lakh women workers via a video bridge interaction and announced an honorarium for them. Those receiving Rs 3,000 so far, would now receive Rs 4,500. Similarly, those receiving Rs 2,200, would now get Rs 3,500. The honorarium for anganwadi helpers has also been increased from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,250. They will also be provided free insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana and other routine incentives given to them by the Union government will also be doubled. Then there are some performance-based incentives. Besides the monetary benefits, the prime minister showered praise on their work at the grassroots — their role in combating malnourishment for mothers and newborn children. Modi linked boys and girls from poorer sections of society winning medals in the recently concluded Asian Games with the efforts of anganwadi and ASHA workers in rural areas. While praising their role and enhancing their remuneration, Modi also entrusted them with additional responsibilities. This is an election year as five states will be going to the polls in next two-and-a-half months and the big bang General Election is due in the next seven months. Thus, the political significance of Modi’s interaction with ASHA, auxiliary nurse midwife and anganwadi workers could not be lost. These workers have penetration in almost every single household, particularly womenfolk around the centres they work. A satisfied group of anganwadi workers could also be potential messengers of Modi government in the hinterland. The number of operational anganwadi centres as on 31 December, 2015 was 13,49,091. The top 10 states in terms of the number of operational centres have been Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Karnataka, Assam, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh-Telangana (undivided). These states also account for 341 parliamentary seats. The politically critical Uttar Pradesh accounts for around 14 percent of the total operational centres in India. Given the kind of goodwill these women generally have in their respective areas of work, an endorsement of the Modi government may help influence voting pattern of a substantial section of womenfolk and possibly their family members also. It seemed to be a well-crafted strategy on the part of the prime minister to directly engage with over 28 women workers in rural areas through a mobile phone application both on account of governance and also eyeing a political dividend. Hours after Modi finished his interaction with them, the BJP leadership fielded Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani to hold a media briefing at party headquarters in New Delhi. After she was shunted from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting four months ago, she has not been visible at the party’s platforms. Her arrival at the new party headquarters to address a press conference signified two things: Her rehabilitation as one the most feisty speakers on issues that matters most for the party and political importance the leadership attached to Modi’s interaction with Anganwadi workers. She was also fielded to get on to her favourite turf and take on Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on the   case. On Monday, the Delhi High Court had dismissed Sonia and Rahul Gandhi’s plea against the income tax department’s decision to re-open their tax assessment for year 2011-12 relating to Associated Journals, publishers of  . The court had also rejected plea by Congress leaders that media be restrained from publishing reports on this count.

"Two Congress MLAs in Gujarat, who were suspended from the state Assembly on March 14, on Tuesday withdrew their   challenging the House’s decision from the Gujarat High Court, PTI reported. They withdrew their plea after their suspension period was reduced. Amrish Der and Baldevji Thakor were earlier barred from attending proceedings in the House for three years and one year respectively, after they were charged with   BJP legislator Jagdish Panchal with a microphone during proceedings on March 14. They were immediately suspended along with their colleague Pratap Dudhat, who also received a three-year ban. Der and Thakor then moved the court, claiming that they had been provoked.

" In one of the sharpest attacks after the recently held Lok Sabha bypoll in Palghar, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday described BJP as its biggest ""political enemy"". The country ""does not"" want the duo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, but could ""accept"" the Congress or JD(S) leader H D Deve Gowda, he said. ""The Shiv Sena is the biggest political enemy of the BJP. The Sena's radical Hinduism would prove problematic for the BJP,"" he said in an opinion piece written in party mouthpiece  Raut is the editor of the Marathi daily. Taking potshots at the saffron party, Raut said the BJP paid tribute to its late MP Chintaman Wanaga by defeating his son, the Sena candidate, in Palghar. The bypoll was necessitated by the death of Chintaman Wanaga. Since the Sena is the main political opponent of the BJP, the latter's plan is to weaken the Uddhav Thackeray-led party while staying in power with it, he alleged. ""Hence, the BJP's plan is to stay with the Sena in power and try to weaken it by using power and money. The BJP used its resources to ensure Shiv Sena's defeat in the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll (held last month),"" Raut said. The Sena leader claimed ""trickery"" of EVMs led to the BJP's victory in Palghar and said it was nothing short of a ""scandal"". ""On the day of voting (28 May), complaints of EVMs malfunctioning were reported from at least 100 locations. The Election Commission rejected the Shiv Sena's request for extending voting hours, but a similar demand of BJP candidate Rajendra Gavit (who won the seat) was accepted,"" he alleged. He claimed that every polling station, where extension for voting was given, reported an ""average 100 extra votes to the BJP nominee and cumulatively BJP's votes increased by some thousands. But some 60,000 voters could not vote"". ""After the voting, the district collector declared 46 percent turnout, but the figure went up to 56 percent the next day (when final figure was announced). It means 82,000 votes increased overnight"", he said. Raut charged that the BJP has appointed people with RSS links to key constitutional posts and controlled the election procedure. He also referred to the setback suffered by the BJP in the just held Lok Sabha and Assembly bypolls in some states. ""The BJP managed to win the Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll but it lost many other Lok Sabha and Assembly bypolls. This shows winds of change are blowing in several parts of the country,"" he said. ""The bypoll results indicate the beginning of the BJP's downfall,"" said the Rajya Sabha MP. He charged that ""the country is in such a state of mind that it can accept the Congress or Deve Gowda, but does not want the Modi- Shah duo"".",PTI
" The results of bypolls in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar do not bode well for the Congress as the strengthening of regional outfits may weaken the grand old party's chances of leading a joint Opposition front for the 2019 general elections. Political observers feel that unless the Congress reclaims some states from the BJP and retains Karnataka in Assembly elections slated to be held later this year, its chances of leading such an alliance may weaken further. The Congress, however, feels that the victory of the SP-BSP combine in Uttar Pradesh is an ""aberration"" and it is the only party with a pan-India presence capable of cobbling together and leading a coalition to defeat the BJP. The Congress was left out of the SP-BSP combine in the Uttar Pradesh bypolls, where the alliance elbowed out the BJP in Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's bastion of Gorakhpur and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya's constituency in Phulpur. While on the one hand, the Congress is seeking to put together a joint Opposition alliance to take the BJP on in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, regional parties are hoping to forge a united front without the Congress as another alternative. TRS chief and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has already taken the lead in this and has been in touch with leaders of other regional parties, such as Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress. The Congress is also carrying on with its efforts to keep the Opposition together. Party leader Sonia Gandhi hosted a dinner recently for all non-BJP parties, an event that was attended by leaders of 20 Opposition parties, including the Congress. Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said it was now ""crystal clear"" that the people of the country had given its ""no confidence"" to the ""Modi brand of politics, driven by rhetoric than reality and guided by headline management than the country's management"". ""Naturally they are looking at alternatives. Opposition political parties are driven by the pressure and will of India's people to save the essence of India's foundational values and come together to defend them despite the disagreement of politics and conflict of interest at times,"" he said. The Congress was the ""only natural party with a pan-India appeal"" which could stitch the coalition together in the fight for ""India's foundational and civilisational values"", he told  . Surjewala was not unduly worried about the party losing ground in the states—its two candidates lost their deposits in the Uttar Pradesh bypolls—and said this was an ""aberration"". ""There will be some aberrations like we saw on Wednesday, yet the umbrella or the path to tread upon will be laid by the Congress, so that everyone can walk ahead hand-in-hand together,"" he said. Another Congress leader, former Union minister S Jaipal Reddy, said the idea of a third front as propagated by Rao was merely a ""stunt"" to ""befool"" the people. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, however, had said yesterday that the verdict of the bypolls showed the anger of the people against the BJP and that they would vote for any non-BJP candidate who had the potential to win. Gandhi also said the Congress party was keen to rebuild the party in Uttar Pradesh but that would not happen overnight. ""The Congress is keen on rebuilding the party in Uttar Pradesh, but that will not happen overnight,"" he tweeted in Hindi yesterday. A senior Congress leader from Uttar Pradesh and a former minister feared that after the bypolls, regional parties SP and BSP might think the Congress was ""irrelevant"" in the state. He said if this idea gained ground, the bargaining power of the Congress could take a severe hit and the party may be given just 5 to 6 seats out of a total of 80 in the state in an electoral arrangement for the next Lok Sabha polls. ""The fate of the Congress is now totally in the hands of these two parties. And neither will want the Congress to contest in more than 5-6 seats out of a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP,"" the former minister told  . The SP and BSP have their own vote banks and will not want the Congress to be strengthened as they fear that it could eat into their constituencies. In the last Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress contested in only 103 of the 403 seats while the SP fought from 298. The situation is not very different in other states such as Karnataka, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where regional players are seeking to flex their muscles and will demand a greater pound of flesh from the Congress. In Karnataka, the BSP and regional outfit JD-S have already tied up and in states such as Maharashtra and West Bengal, the NCP and the TMC would want to dominate the electoral arrangements. The Congress, poll analysts said, can strengthen its position only if it wins Karnataka and later states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where it is in a direct contest with the BJP.",PTI

" Continuing his attack on the Janata Dal (Secular), Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asked former prime minister HD Deve Gowda's party to come clean on its support to the BJP. ""JD(S), they have to make it clear whether they are the BJP's B team or not,"" Gandhi said at a public meeting in K R Pete in the Vokkaliga belt of the old Mysuru region, considered a JD(S) stronghold. ""They (JD-S) have to make it clear whether they are supporting the BJP, if yes, why? The JD(S) stands for 'Janata Dal Sangh Parivar',"" he added.

Praising the Siddaramaiah government in the state, he said it had worked for the poor, downtrodden and backward communities. Gandhi even credited the chief minister with running a ""clean government"".

"On Wednesday, 26 September, the Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 on the grounds of it being violative of the fundamental right to privacy. A five-judge constitution bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice AK Sikri, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan reserved the verdict on 10 May after hearing the petitions for over 38 days starting 17 January. The bench was informed by Attorney General K K Venugopal that this has become the ""second longest"" case in terms of days of hearing after the historic Kesavananda Bharati case of 1973. The Kesavananda Bharati case, which was heard by a 13-judge bench, by a majority of 7:6 had propounded the doctrine of 'Basic Structure and of the Constitution' had held that the amendments which may affect this structure were subject to judicial review. Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium advanced the rejoinder submissions and said Aadhaar was not an ""affirmative action"" on the part of state to serve the people. ""Is the Act an enabler or is it in the guise of an enabler? The Act is not an instrumentality to deliver services. It is only a means of identification,"" he said. ""We have to read the true purpose of the law and whether the law seeks to achieve that purpose. Dignity and autonomy is not preserved by section 7 of the Aadhaar Act,"" he said. Aadhaar Act did not have a proper purpose and ""a claim to a proper purpose is not proper purpose"", he said, adding that ""Authentication is at the heart of the Act. Failure of authentication is a ground for denial of services."" The State seeks to take away the data without the backing of a strong data protection framework, he argued. To this, the bench said the Act like Aadhaar needed a regulator which was presently absent. The senior lawyer said private players have been allowed in the Act to have the access to Aadhaar data and moreover, there was no regime of protection. Senior advocate Arvind Datar said the government did not need to arrest or detain a citizen as it can simply ""switch off"" a person. ""Under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Aadhaar is not just confined to banks but has gone beyond it's scope. Aadhaar is needed for mutual funds, insurance policies and credit cards as well, among other things. ""Only magic words like black money, national security and terrorism are being thrown around by the State. The justification of a law for proportionality cannot be a ritualistic exercise,"" Datar said. A battery of senior lawyers, including Shyam Divan, Gopal Subramanium, Kapil Sibal, P Chidambaram, Arvind Datar, K V Vishwanath, Anand Grover, Sajan Poovayya and a few others, argued on behalf of petitioners opposing the Aadhaar Scheme on various grounds. Besides the former HC judge, the top lawyers argued for petitioners, who included Magsaysay awardee Shanta Sinha, feminist researcher Kalyani Sen Menon, social activists Aruna Roy, Nikhil De, Nachiket Udupa and CPI leader Binoy Visman. A key argument against the Aadhaar scheme was that it was violative of the nine-judge bench verdict that had held that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right under the Constitution. The Centre and the Unique Identificaiton Authority of India (UIDAI), the governments of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the RBI had argued in favour of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits And Services) Act, 2016 and were represented by the Attorney General, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Jayant Bhushan and lawyer Zoheb Hossain. During the arguments, the Centre had strongly defended its decision to seed Aadhaar numbers with mobile phones, telling the top court that it could have been hauled up for contempt if the verification of mobile users was not undertaken by it. However, the court had said that the government had misinterpreted its order and used it as a ""tool"" to make Aadhaar mandatory for mobile users. The court had also not agreed  with the government's contention that the Aadhaar law was correctly termed as a Money Bill by the Lok Sabha Speaker as it dealt with ""targeted delivery of subsidies"" for which funds came from the Consolidated Fund of India. Divan, who had opened the arguments on behalf of the opponents, had termed Aadhaar as ""an electronic leash"" and said that the government could completely destroy an individual by ""switching off"" the 12-digit unique identifier number. On the other hand, the Centre had said that the law was valid and allowed minimal invasion to ensure the right to life of millions of Indians by ensuring seamless delivery of subsidies, benefits and services to the poorest of poor.

" Vishal Kumar The nation on Monday witnessed widespread protests by Dalit organisations over the Supreme Court’s verdict on the SC/ST atrocities act. The protests gain significance in the year before 2019 general elections and raise important questions on the Central government’s stand on the matter. In the backdrop of these recent developments,  ’s Editorial Director Sanjay Pugalia spoke to Socioligist Dilip C Mandal, who said the apex court’s order had made the law rather blunt. As far as the Centre is concerned, Mandal maintained that it too, had fallen on the wrong side and should have passed an ordinance against the SC’s order. Echoing Mandal, Pugalia noted that the government had failed to feel the pulse of the Dalit agitation and has been dragging its feet over filing a review petition in the courts. Mandal feels it is too early to hold any particular group responsible for the unrest, but he’s sure that it laid bare the anger among Dalit masses in the country. He, however, maintains that violence is not the way out and must not be resorted to at any cost. Monday’s stir, although spurred by the Supreme Court’s order, does have a wider backdrop, said Pugalia. He cites recent incidents of discrimination against the Dalit community, which have caused them to come out in the streets. But as mentioned earlier, the Dalit agitation also speaks to a wider political discourse ahead of the looming general elections in 2019. Pugalia feels that a bevy of Dalit political workers are prepping for the elections, and it is up to the Opposition to amplify these dissenting and powerful voices. Dilip Mandal says the BJP will have to bear its political loss in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. There is a big difficulty in front of him. Now the government should have brought an ordinance instead of review petitions or should have made the law which was missed. For now, it’s amptly clear that desperate attempts made by the BJP and the Sangh to bring the Dalit community within the Hinduthva umbrella have backfired and snowballed into a massive  In the coming days, its effect will be clearly seen among the political parties of the country.

With a   by  and   predicting a close contest between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress but neither party enjoying an absolute majority, HD Deve Gowda’s JD(S) is expected to emerge as the kingmaker.

As for BSP, which has entered into a pre-poll alliance with JD(S) ahead of the Assembly elections in the state, the election is all about   with Mayawati's fortunes dwindling in Uttar Pradesh. Let's take a detailed look at which party has planned what in the upcoming days in poll-bound Karnataka. Congress president Rahul Gandhi arrived in Karnataka on Thursday to kickstart the   in the southern state. During his two-day visit, Rahul will address several meetings in the state and release the party's election manifesto for the upcoming Assembly elections. Congress chief will visit Uttara (North) Kannada district in the northwestern part of the state on Thursday to hold several public meetings in Ankola, Kumta, Honnavar, and Bhatkal. ""Rahul will also release the election manifesto in Mangaluru on Friday in the presence of senior leaders like (Karnataka in-charge) KC Venugopal and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah,"" Congress state unit spokesman Ravi Gowda told   in Bengaluru. Rahul will later address public meetings in Bantwal and Gonikoppal towns in Dakshina (South) Kannada district on Friday. In the evening, the Congress leader will address a public meeting in Periyapatna in Mysuru district. Rahul Gandhi's mother and former party chief Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, senior leaders Shashi Tharoor, Mallikarjun Kharge and Ghulam Nabi Azad, among others, will also visit the state for campaigning. So far, Congress chief has held six rounds of campaigning in the southern state. The sixth phase of campaigning was on 7-8 April. BJP will fly in some 40 ""star campaigners"" to poll-bound Karnataka, including Modi, a host of Union ministers and senior leaders to campaign for the party's success in the ensuing polls Modi is likely to address about 20 rallies in Karnataka to boost BJP's campaign in a state where his party is locked in a keen fight with Congress. Party sources said Modi, BJP's biggest crowd-puller, is likely to kick off a series of rallies in the southern state from 1 May. Though he has addressed public meetings in the state earlier, he has not hit the campaign trail since the Election Commission announced the Assembly election schedule on 27 March. BJP sources said that a final programme of Modi's election tour is still being finalised and he is expected to address anywhere between 15-20 rallies. The saffron party is making all-out efforts to oust the Siddaramaiah dispensation from power in the state. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is among the BJP's star campaigners in the upcoming Assembly elections, will visit Karnataka on 3 and 4 May and then from 7 to 10 May. Adityanath will be seen in action, addressing as many as 35 rallies and road shows the saffron party has organised for him as the Nath sect, to which he belongs, wields considerable 
clout in coastal Karnataka, BJP sources said on Thursday.   “After Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Tripura, chief minister Yogi Adityanath is one of the most sought-after leaders in the Karnataka campaign,”  quoted a party leader as saying. BJP leaders say that the UP chief minister is very likely to launch a counter-offensive against the remarks that were made against him by Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao earlier this month. Rao had set the tone for Adityanath's visit by openly asking the people of Karnataka to boycott him. He later apologised for his remarks, describing them as an ""emotional outburst."" Earlier, during his February visit, Adityanath had taken on Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on the microblogging site, which blew up into a twitter war between the two chief ministers. In between his rallies and road shows, Adityanath is also expected to visit temples and mutts as the BJP looks to play the Hindutva card in a state where it is anxious to regain power it lost 10 years ago. In December last, while addressing a ""Parivartan Yatra"" rally in Hubbali, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister had stoked passions by asking people to choose between Hanuman Jayanti and Tipu Jayanti — a remark aimed at questioning Congress' two-year-old decision to commemorate the birth anniversary of Tipu Sultan, the 18th century ruler who hailed from the region. Besides Modi, Adityanath, and BJP national president Amit Shah, Union ministers Sushma Swaraj, Smriti Irani, Nirmala Sitharaman, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Piyush Goyal, as well as veteran actor and MP Hema Malini are also expected to visit the southern state. BSP supremo   whose party has entered into a pact with former prime minister Deve Gowda's JD(S), has already started working in the state with her rallies starting 
on Wednesday from Mysuru. She will be addressing a rally in Chitradurga on Thursday and Belagavi and Bidar on 5 and 6 May respectively. Mayawati who is currently touring Karnataka will also share the stage with the JD(S) leadership at public rallies. The BSP is contesting on 20 seats in Karnataka and is hoping to open an account there with the JD(S) support. Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav will also be touring the state to champion his party's cause in those constituencies where the Samajwadi Party is in the fray.

" Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday launched a blistering attack on the Shiv Sena and accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led party of ""back stabbing"" the BJP. He said Sena's actions are contrary to teachings of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, revered as Hindutva idol by the saffron party. Addressing a campaign rally for the 28 May Palghar Lok Sabha bypoll in Virar, an extended suburb of Mumbai, Adityanath said the country can progress only under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. He targetted bickering alliance partner Shiv Sena for ""poking its nose"" in the BJP's internal affairs, by fielding late MP Chintaman Wanaga's son Srinivas for the byelection. ""The way this party has back-stabbed the BJP by fielding its own candidate...I can say that late Bal Thackeray's soul must be in deep pain and anguish,"" the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said without taking name of the Sena. He said the victory of BJP candidate Rajendra Gavit would be a ""rich tribute"" to the late Sena patriarch. Virar, one of the six Assembly segments of Palghar Lok Sabha constituency, has a sizable number of north Indian voters apart from Maharashtrians. ""These people invoke Shivaji Maharaj in everything, but in reality they act like Afzal Khan. We won't allow this. Shivaji Maharaj and Balasaheb Thackeray always fought against anti-national elements,"" he said. Afzal Khan was a medieval commander who served the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur, and fought against Shivaji. He was killed at a meeting with the Maratha king, and his army was defeated in the Battle of Pratapgad. The BJP has made the bypoll a prestige issue and has been accusing the Sena of trying to hijack the legacy of late Wanaga. Without naming Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Adityanath accused the saffron party of dividing Hindu votes. ""Balasaheb never believed in back-stabbing. He was a warrior who believed in fighting from the front. He worked for making country stronger. But see what has happened. They (Sena) broke up Wanaga's family and forced him (the late BJP MP's son) to contest the bypoll. This was an internal matter of BJP and we would have protected the self-respect of the Wanaga family,"" he said. The actions of this party (Sena) are not in sync with dreams of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. ""People of Maharashtra will teach them a lesson,"" he said. ""This bypoll won't impact the stability of the government but it will definitely give a message that the country can progress only under Modi's leadership,"" he said. The UP CM's remarks came hours after JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy was sworn in as Karnataka chief minister at a grand ceremony attended by a galaxy of top leaders and regional satraps in a rare public show of unity perceived as a possible harbinger of a broad-based anti-BJP alliance ahead of the Lok Sabha polls next year. ""I have come here to appeal to you to vote for BJP, whose government under Modi's leadership is taking India on the path of progress,"" he said. ""The symbol of this progress can be only lotus (BJP's symbol) and nothing else,"" he added. ""There is an attempt to create an atmosphere against the BJP,"" he said. ""By God's grace, the Congress has been decimated in the country,"" he said, adding that the ""enemies of development and good governance will also meet the same fate"". The BJP has drafted in a battery of its leaders in Palghar. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is spearheading the BJP's campaign in urban segments of the constituency.

In his address which he opened in Marathi, Adityanath underlined the ""cultural and historical relations"" between two states. ""Those who see the two states with different glasses, they seem like anti-India,"" he said. Adityanath praised Fadnavis for ""making efforts to weed out corruption and 'Gundaraj' in Maharashtra"".

Recalling his past experience of working with late Wanaga, Adityanath said, ""Wanagaji raised issues of the common man in Parliament with full commitment and did several outstanding works.

" Congress floor leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday said he would talk to AICC president Rahul Gandhi on filling the remaining six ministerial berths allocated to the party in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government to prevent dissident activity. ""Let me see. I will discuss with Rahul  , if I get to meet him in New Delhi, about considering immediate filling of the remaining six berths allocated to the Congress to prevent dissidence among our ministerial aspirants,"" he said. The statement comes in the wake of state party leaders MB Patil and Satish Jarkiholi expressing their disappointment over   in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government headed by HD Kumaraswamy. Patil and Jarkiholi have been vociferous among the disappointed Congress leaders such as Roshan Baig, NA Harris, Ramalinga Reddy and HK Patil, who have been denied cabinet berths. Under the power sharing agreement, the Congress has been allotted 22 berths and the JD(S) 12. The JDS-Congress cabinet was expanded on 6 June with the induction of 25 new ministers, after intense bargaining for ministerial berths. The Congress has left six vacancies to be filled under its quota and the JD(S) one. Asked how the AICC and the KPCC planned to pacify senior Congress leaders who had been ministers, Kharge said the high command would discuss with them and find a solution soon. ""Our high command will discuss with them (senior Congress leaders, who also were ministers in previous governments) and solve the problem in the next few days. Already, KC Venugopal (AICC general secretary) and Ghulam Nabi Azad are also in touch with them. There is no problem and everything will be solved,"" he said. Kharge said these leaders ""are loyalists and have not spoken of deserting the party as they are interested in strengthening, not deserting it"". ""We have expanded the cabinet and portfolios distributed. Heartburn among our ministerial aspirants, including MB Patil and Jarkiholi, who did not get berths, will subside. That will happen because they are interested in strengthening the party, not deserting it,"" he said. They all want to build a strong party in view of the Lok Sabha elections scheduled next year, Kharge added. Asked whether the party was contemplating a rotational ministerial policy to pacify the disgruntled legislators, Kharge said he had picked this up in the media that it was the thought of the party working president. ""Whatever it may be, in the interest of the party, the leaders and the high command will take appropriate decisions and all party workers will follow suit,"" he added. Asked if the All India Congress Committee or the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee was considering 30-30 power arrangement (each coalition partner heading the government for 30 months), Kharge said the question does not arise for now because terms and conditions of  ""coalition  "" between Congress and JD(S) were announced by Venugopal, which is binding on all leaders. On whether he was unhappy with the portfolios allocated to the Congress, Kharge said he was unhappy over the party not getting a majority in the Assembly polls, instead of ruing over the JD(S) hogging all plum portfolios. ""By unhappiness I mean, we did not get a majority. Had we got it, we would not have formed a coalition government. In coalition, we have to adopt a 'give and take' policy,"" he said.",Press Trust of India

": The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would fight all the 40 assembly seats in Mizoram alone, but the party might forge an alliance with like-minded parties in a post-poll scenario, general secretary Ram Madhav said on Wednesday. Mizoram is the only state under the Congress in the Northeast at present. The saffron party has been making concerted efforts to win the state, after having formed governments on its own or joining hands with allies in all other Northeastern states. Addressing a press conference in Aizawl, Madhav, who is in charge of the Northeast, said the BJP would field candidates in all the 40 assembly seats in the state, where elections are due in December. In the 2013 assembly poll, the Congress had won 34 seats and made Lal Thanhawala the chief minister, while the BJP has no MLA at present. On the Opposition calling the Mizo National Front (MNF) ""proxy"" of the BJP, the general secretary termed it ""ridiculous"". ""The party would contest against the MNF and the National People's Party in the polls, though they are constituents of North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA),"" Madhav said. The NEDA is a political coalition formed in 2016 by the BJP, along with Northeast regional parties like Naga People's Front, Sikkim Democratic Front, People's Party of Arunachal, Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland People's Front. Madhav asserted that the BJP ""respected"" the food habits, distinct cultural and customs of the Mizos and their religion. He accused the ruling Congress, headed by Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla - in power for 10 years - of being corrupt and inefficient. ""The Thanhawla regime did not create any basic infrastructural development during the last decade, though the Centre initiated and funded several developmental projects,"" the BJP leader said. ""If voted to power, the BJP would construct a four-lane highway across the state, linking both Myanmar and Bangladesh,"" Madhav said.

"Facing criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for his 'Hindu Pakistan' remark, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has now been sued by a Kolkata-based advocate Sumeet Chowdhury on Friday, 13 July, for ''hurting religious sentiments and insulting the Constitution”. A Kolkata court has reportedly summoned the MP on 14 August. Tharoor, on Thursday, had said that if the BJP wins 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it will lead to the formation of a 'Hindu Pakistan'. A case under Section 153A/295A of the Indian Penal Code and Section 2 of The Prevention Of Insults To National Honour Act, 1971 has been filed against Tharoor by Chowdhury. The counsel who moved this petition, in his complaint, said: While reports said the summon has been issued and has been allowed to be served to Tharoor through his Twitter handle by the counsel, when   got in touch with him, Tharoor said he has “received nothing so far”. This is the first time in the history of Indian judiciary that a summon will be issued through Twitter,     reported the petitioner as saying. The petitioner said that Tharoor has also insulted Indians by comparing an Islamic State like Pakistan with a secular State like India. “He has also ignored the fact that India is a far superior nation compared to Pakistan, which most countries scorn and disdain,” Chowdhury said in his complaint. Even as Tharoor on Thursday, defended his remark, the Congress asked party leaders to exercise caution while “rejecting BJP’s hatred”. Speaking at an event discussing the 'Threats faced by Indian Democracy and Secularism' on Wednesday, 11 July, Tharoor had said that India would become a ""Hindu Pakistan"", if BJP came to power in 2019. “If they (BJP) win a repeat in the Lok Sabha, our democratic Constitution as we understand it will not survive, as they will have all the elements they need to tear apart the Constitution of India and write a new one,” Tharoor had said. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra poured scorn on the Congress leader, saying that the latter had once again “cattle-classed” Indian democracy. “The Congress' character is that it crosses the 'Lakshman Rekha' (limit) in its hatred for Narendra Modi and the BJP, and in doing so, it assaults Indian democracy,"" he told reporters. ""This is a shameful act for which Rahul Gandhi should come out and not only apologise but explain to us why any leader of that party, whenever they open their mounth, they speak this way,"" he said. Union Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that the Congress MP's remark was “pure hallucination”. “I think this is a symptom of the fact that they are neither in power nor do they see power coming their way again,” he said, adding that it was the Congress “that has infringed our Constitution and the freedom of citizens.” Hours later, Tharoor shared photographs of his visit to Poonthura ShivaKshetram on Twitter, quipping, “Just before being accused of being anti-Hindu.” Despite the BJP launching a scathing attack on Tharoor, the Congress leader stood his ground on Thursday and refused to apologise. On Friday, Tharoor took to Twitter and tweeted the song 'kuchh to log kahenge logon ka kaam hai kehnaa' from the 1971 hit film 'Amar Prem' to take on his critics. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, too, on Twitter cautioned the party leaders, saying that they must “realise this historic responsibility bestowed upon us while choosing words and phraseology to reject BJP’s hatred.” Priyanka Chaturvedi, another Congress spokesperson, on the other hand, saw nothing wrong with Tharoor's remark, denying the suggestion that it was ""embarrassing"" in any manner. “It's his personal stance. The Congress is very clear where it stands on this,” she told ANI. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint
" Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday accused the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and the Centre of ""unleashing"" the lieutenant governor, IAS officials and agencies such as the CBI, ED, Income Tax Department and the Delhi Police on the AAP government to stall its functioning.

" The ruling Congress in Karnataka on Thursday staged a protest against the alleged misuse of central agencies by the BJP-led NDA government to target party leaders ahead of the state assembly polls. Several Congress leaders and workers, led by Karnataka PCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao, held a protest march from the KPCC office to the Income Tax Department office. Some protesters shouting pro-Congress and NSUI slogans managed to throw black ink on the nameplate of the GST and Customs headquarters, before they were detained, police said. A top Income Tax department official termed the charge as a claim made by a political party and said if anybody has a genuine grouse over a raid, they can move court. The protest came a day after state Water Resources Minister MB Patil alleged that phones used by him and his family members were being tapped. The minister had also expressed fears about Income Tax raids against him before the code of conduct for the state assembly polls came into force. ""The misuse of the IT/Enforcement Directorate against Congress leaders of Karnataka is not only damaging to the fabric of democracy but also impinges on the impending elections in the state. #BJPVendettaPolitics,"" the KPCC said in a tweet. The party said the protest march was against the ""misuse"" of the Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation as ""tools"" of the BJP against Congress leaders. A letter was also submitted to the chairperson of the Central Board of Direct Taxes. In the letter, the Congress said Karnataka was all set for elections this year. ""We believe that certain actions of your department's officials exceed the constitutional mandate accorded to them and vitiate the spirit of our elections,"" it claimed. The party cited the raids on state Energy Minister D K Shivakumar last year, calling it ""procedurally unsound."" It blamed the BJP for the raids ""with an intention to malign the minister and grab power in the state."" The ""most unfortunate"", however, has been reports of a senior IT official threatening raids on those not willing to make concessions or yield to pressure of relinquishing their political affiliations in the BJP's favour, it claimed. ""This not only undermines the credibility of the enforcement wing of the government but puts the entire integrity of the department under a shadow of doubt,"" the party alleged. Hitting out at the ruling party, BJP leader and former deputy chief minister R Ashoka said the Congress was ""hallucinating"". ""Never in the history of the country has such a protest and splashing of ink on Income Tax offices taken place. The Congress' conduct is demeaning,"" he said. Ashoka said several such IT raids on political leaders and businesses have taken place in the past. At a press conference, when asked about the Congress protest against IT department being used as a ""tool"" against opponents, Director General IT (Investigation) B R Balakrishnan said, ""It is a claim made by a political party what we can do? We don't have anything to say.It is between the election commission and the persons who are alleging."" Asked about the charge that the present government at the Centre was targeting the opposition ever since it came to power, he said, ""We cannot prevent people from alleging. We are also open to public scrutiny."" He said if anybody has genuine grouse they can file a writ petition that the search in that case was not correct. ""Now, political allegations I cannot answer.I am not here to answer political statements. We live in democracy. Why should I be scared of protests. They only requested to transmit their representation to the chairman, which we did,"" he said, replying to a question.",PTI

"The Election Commission is learnt to have recommended to the president the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs for allegedly holding an office of profit. In its opinion sent to President Ram Nath Kovind, the Election Commission said that by being parliamentary secretaries, they held an office of profit and were liable to be disqualified as MLAs of the Delhi Assembly, highly placed sources said. The president is bound to go by the recommendation of the Commission. In cases where petitions are made seeking disqualification of lawmakers, the president sends a reference to the EC which decides on the case by sending back its opinion. According to a   report, sources said if the president accepts the recommendation, Delhi will see a mini-Assembly election, with 20 seats up for grabs in the 70-member House. The EC's recommendation serves as a major jolt to the ruling party in Delhi. The election body was hearing a plea against the party's nearly two dozen MLAs. They were accused of allegedly holding an office of profit despite the Delhi High Court setting aside their appointment as parliamentary secretaries. The decision comes days before Achal Kumar Joti retires as the Chief Election Commissioner. Election Commissioner OP Rawat, who recused himself from the case after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had questioned his impartiality, has not signed the order. When contacted by   Joti said that since the matter is sub-judice, he would not offer any comment on the issue. An office of profit means a position that brings to the person holding it some financial gain, or advantage, or benefit. It may be an office or place of profit if it carries some remuneration, financial advantage, benefit etc. The amount of such profit is immaterial. The ""office of profit"" controversy was sparked off after a 30-year old lawyer, Prashant Patel, filed an application in 2015 to the president's office, questioning the appointment of AAP MLAs as parliamentary secretaries. In 2015, soon after AAP swept the Delhi elections, Kejriwal had appointed 21 legislators as parliamentary secretaries. The petition filed in the high court had sought their disqualification saying the Constitution does not allow elected representatives to hold offices of profit. The Election Commission was asked to give its opinion, according to an   report. The AAP had said the recommendation was based on false allegations, alleging that the ""BJP through its agents seriously compromises the prestige of the EC just to divert the attention of the nation from its all-around failures. ""What (the) Modi government appointed Election Commission is leaking to the media is a recommendation made without hearing the arguments of MLAs on the false allegation of office of profit. Such a blatantly biased recommendation will not stand scrutiny in the court of law. ""This must be the first ever recommendation in EC history where a recommendation has been sent without even hearing the main matter on merits. No hearing took place in the EC on the point of office of profit,"" AAP spokesperson Nagendra Sharma had tweeted. According to a   report, the poll panel, in June last year, had said that the AAP MLAs ""did hold de facto the office of parliamentary secretaries"". The panel last year in October issued a notice to the AAP MLAs seeking an explanation after rejecting their pleas to drop the 'office of profit' case against them. In March 2015, the AAP government passed an amendment to the Delhi Members of Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1997, to exempt the posts of parliamentary secretary from the definition of office of profit with retrospective effect. But then president Pranab Mukherjee refused to give assent, following which the appointments were set aside by the Delhi High Court in September 2016, declaring them illegal since the order had been passed ""without concurrence/approval of the Lt Governor"". According to the   report, the AAP has an option to challenge the Election Commission ruling in the higher court. The move will pave the way for bypolls in Delhi for 20 constituencies of the 70-member Assembly after presidential assent. The AAP at present has officially 66 members in the House although some have since turned dissidents. The other four seats are held by the BJP. Even if 20 MLAs are disqualified, the ruling party will still have a comfortable majority in the Delhi Assembly. The MLAs who face axe are Alka Lamba, Adarsh Shastri, Sanjeev Jha, Rajesh Gupta, Kailash Gehlot, Vijendra Garg, Praveen Kumar, Sharad Kumar, Madan Lal Khufiya, Shiv Charan Goyal, Sarita Singh, Naresh Yadav, Rajesh Rishi, Anil Kumar, Som Dutt, Avtar Singh, Sukhvir Singh Dala, Manoj Kumar, Nitin Tyagi and Jarnail Singh (Tilak Nagar).",FP Staff

" Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday said he was fighting a "" "" to secure the state's 'legitimate' rights and parties at national level were backing TDP's no-confidence motion against the NDA government due to his party's credibility. Speaking to reporters hours after the TDP quit the BJP-led NDA and moved the notice for the motion in Lok Sabha, Naidu said he would now go ahead and bring various parties at the national level together. The TDP supremo said he had not contacted any party yet but given the ""TDP’s credibility"" they were supporting the no-trust motion. ""We are fighting a   against the Centre to secure our state’s legitimate rights. TDP has a credibility at the national level, so many parties are coming forward to support us. I will soon speak to those who are ready to support us,"" he said. Naidu said he was now free to talk with any party which he could not do while being a partner of the ruling alliance at the Centre. ""I now have no obligations and I will go ahead by bringing various parties at the national level together,"" he added. The TDP, which had recently pulled out its ministers from the Modi government, on Friday morning decided to quit the NDA. The party later moved a no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha against the Modi government demanding that the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 be implemented completely and also the promises made by the then prime minister Manmohan Singh in Rajya Sabha be honoured. “We came out of the NDA because of moral values. Only then we moved a no-confidence motion. Those who don’t have any moral values were making rounds of the Prime Minister’s Office,” Chandrababu said, in an obvious reference to the YSR Congress that also moved a no-trust motion. The TDP decided to move the motion on its own rather than support the one moved by a party that ""did not have any moral values"", he said. Earlier, speaking in the state Legislative Council on a short discussion on implementation of the AP Reorganisation Act, the chief minister explained the reasons for the TDP exiting the NDA. ""We joined the NDA in the first place only to protect our state’s interests in the aftermath of bifurcation. We waited for four years with the hope that the Centre will honour all the promises but it only meted out injustice to us,” Naidu said. However, the BJP never cared about TDP, he charged adding that while in the Opposition, it promised to take care of the state and its needs but once in power, ""it completely ignored us."" Coming down on the prime minister, he said Modi did not even bother to invite the TDP MPs for a discussion when they were agitating in Parliament for the state’s rights. He said Modi showed a lot of concern for Andhra Pradesh on the eve of 2014 elections and promised many things, including building the state’s new capital better than New Delhi. The chief minister wanted to know what happened to all those promises. ""Why was the Centre not co-operating in building Amaravati?"" he asked. The TDP supremo charged both YSR Congress and the Jana Sena, the main rivals for TDP in the state, with colluding with the BJP. “Whose interests are they seeking to protect,” he questioned angrily and found fault with the prime minister for trying to enact ""a Tamil Nadu-type drama in Andhra as well."" ""O Pannerselvam himself said he agreed to accept the deputy chief minister post at the behest of Narendra Modi. The Council later adopted a resolution demanding that the Centre implement all provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act and also the promises made in Rajya Sabha.",PTI

" Shohini Bose  Mohd. Irshad Alam From literature and cinema to politics, M Karunanidhi swayed Tamil Nadu for a long, long time. At the age of 94, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) President breathed his last on 7 August, plunging the state into mourning. With Karunanidhi’s death so soon after Jayalalithaa’s, Tamil Nadu politics has lost the two personalities who set the stage for the state’s biggest political rivalry – and in a span of only two years.   Born on 3 June 1924 as ‘Dakshinamoorthy’ in Thirukuvalai, Nagapattinam district, Karunanidhi went on to marry thrice, and had six children. As a young teen, Karunanidhi was heavily influenced by the speeches of Alagiriswami, who was considered the pillar of the Justice Party – an organisation which was formed to represent the non-Brahmins in the state, later going on to form the bedrock of the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK). Popularly known as “Kalaignar”, a title that was given to him by MR Radha, which literally translates to “artist”, Karunanidhi earned the masses’ love for his work in the fields of literature and poetry, having penned scripts for several Tamil films. His life-long tryst with Dravidian politics reflected in his screenwriting and playwriting, which often propagated Dravidian ideologies like self-respect marriages and the abolition of untouchability. Karunanidhi first wrote for a film – Rajakumari – in 1947, while his last script titled ‘Illaingan’ came in 2010. His sharp screenplay in  (1952), a trendsetter Tamil movie, would illustrate how films were used by the DMK to propagate its ideals and ensconce itself deep in public consciousness. The film heavily criticised Brahminisim and upper-caste Hindu customs, and was even banned briefly, before it released to acquire cult status. Riding on the film’s success, Karunanidhi penned several similar films, which, coupled with his wit and charisma, propelled him as a politician, subsequently enabling him to serve five full terms as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu. Having entered politics at the age of 14, the DMK supremo remained an immensely influential figure in the political narrative of Tamil Nadu in a career that spanned over six decades. He became a part of the Dravidian movement led by reformist leader Periyar EVR when he was still a teen. The Dravidian movement propagated by Periyar was “anti-Brahaministic” in nature and sought to create a society where the backward-classes have equal rights. When the Dravida Kazhagam split in 1949 to become the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) under the leadership of CN Annadurai, Karunanidhi, an ardent follower of the Dravidian ideologue, followed in his footsteps. Winning his first election from the Kulithalai assembly of Thiruchirapalli district in 1957, Karunanidhi worked his way up the ranks to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu 12 years later. He was then 45 years old. But long before this, he made his first mark in the socio-political landscape of Tamil Nadu in 1953, when he led the famous “Kallakudi agitation” and lay over the railway tracks to protest the renaming of the Dalmiapuram station. The primary reason behind the protest was the objection raised by the DMK workers over the town being renamed “to honour a north Indian industrialist.” Following this agitation, Karunanidhi went on to gain political prominence in Tamil Nadu in the next two decades, acting as a leading voice in the Dravidian movement. His efforts helped him emerge as a leading regional player in Tamil Nadu, securing him two successive terms in the chief minister’s office between 1969 and 1976. The rivalry between M Karunanidhi and MGR is well-known and is what led to the formation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). After Annadurai's death, Karunanidhi had nominated his son as next in line for the DMK, brushing aside MGR. Once a great friend and the perfect star vessel for his words, MGR turned political rival. In the year 1972, MGR was expelled from DMK and the every same year, AIADMK was formed. Karunanidhi suffered debacle after debacle after this split. However, this couldn’t break Karunanidhi’s never-say-die spirit. He kept the party alive, slamming the ruling AIADMK on its governance. And with MGR passing away in 1987, Karunanidhi was there to fill the vacuum. Despite being shunted into political ignominy by MGR for over a decade, Karunanidhi wrote a touching obituary for MGR at the time of his death, exalting his work and friendship. But Jayalalithaa had inherited the rivalry. For the majority of the people in the Hindi-speaking belt, Karunanidhi remained Jayalalithaa’s greatest political rival. Pitted against Amma by the anti-Hindi Dravidian movement, Karunanidhi fought off many storms, and to his credit, holds the record of winning a seat every time he contested in the state elections. In recent years, however, he was reduced to fighting corruption charges against him and his family members. The CBI in 2011 arrested Karunanidhi’s daughter Kanimozhi, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP, and former telecom minister Andimuthu Raja, a member of the DMK, in connection with the 2G scam. At the time of arrest, A Raja was very close to the Karunanidhi family, having been nominated by the supremo to be a Union Minister under the UPA regime in 2004. In December 2017, the Supreme Court acquitted Kanimozhi and A Raja in the 2G scam case, a verdict which was hailed as a “moral victory” by the DMK at a time when it was at its lowest political ebb. A seasoned politician, Karunanidhi successfully manoeuvred through rough waters at the time of MGR’s exit in 1972. A mass hero, MGR swayed the majority of the DMK’s vote bank in favour of his newly-formed AIADMK in the 1977 state elections, which saw him earn the CM’s office for the first time. The DMK stayed out of power till MGR’s death, and Karunanidhi finally gained control of the CMO once again in 1989. He even handled the expulsion of Vaiko in 1993, when the latter took along with him many of his party-men, including district secretaries. Vaiko, who was styled as Karunanidhi’s protegé, quit the party amid rumours that the party reins would be handed over to the latter’s son, Stalin, over him. In trying times, Karunanidhi led a series of agitations to keep the political pot boiling, targeting the ruling AIADMK. He constantly kept his ear to the ground, engaging party workers through his   (Kalaignar’s letter to cadres) in the party mouthpiece  . Through his  , a memoir of sorts, he kept in touch with party functionaries. He also handled intra-family power struggles involving his sons MK Stalin and MK Alagiri, and in what he claimed to be a decision in the party’s interest, he expelled his older son Alagiri in 2014 to keep the DMK under his firm grip. The tussle between the two sons had reached its peak in 2007, when supporters of Alagiri attacked the Madurai office of  a Sun network-owned publication –that was accused of favouring Stalin. Things went swiftly downhill from this point, culminating in Alagiri’s dismissal from the party, authorised by Karunanidhi. After a life of successfully battling political headwinds, this has been Karunanidhi’s enduring legacy – a strong anti-Hindi, anti-Centre machinery in Tamil Nadu.

"As Andhra Pradesh chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu held a crucial parliamentary board meeting with the party MPs and senior MLA to review ties with its ally BJP, Amit Shah reportedly rang up Naidu asking him not to take ""tough decisions"".

It has nothing to do with the Budget. We will fulfill all that has been promised to the people of Andhra Pradesh,” Jaitley had told  . BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav on Saturday had also said that the party and the Centre would soon be extending the olive branch to Naidu to resolve the issue,   reported. ""There seems to be some kind of unhappiness, we will talk it out. TDP is an old ally of BJP. We will talk it out with them and will tell them we are committed to the interests of Andhra Pradesh,"" Madhav was quoted as saying by  On Friday it was reported that there was a ""strong mood"" among TDP leaders to break away from the alliance with the BJP, the sources had said. Some senior TDP leaders had said off the record that almost everyone, including many district unit chiefs, wanted the TDP to end the alliance with BJP after the budget ""ignored"" the state. However, according to party sources, Naidu had apparently dissuaded his senior party colleagues from speaking about the fate of the alliance with BJP and dwelt on the Rajasthan bypoll results where the BJP tasted defeat. The TDP sources said that according to Naidu, the bypoll results were a clear example that people would be unsparing if governance was not good. Naidu also reportedly expressed ""serious displeasure"" over the Union budget and wondered why the Centre ignored the state.

" BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Sunday said the NDA government at the Centre needed to be given another five-year term in order to fulfil its promises, but went on to add that the country's economy was ""not in a good state"" as he was not the finance minister. He was speaking at a function titled ""India's Grand Narrative"", organised by the Virat Hindustan Sangam in Mumbai. ""Economic development is not going to bring in votes. (Former prime minister Atal Bihari) Vajpayeeji used 'India Shining' as his government's campaign motto but failed. The BJP promised reassertion in its faith (Hindutva) and a corruption-free government. Hence, it won so many seats in 2014,"" the Rajya Sabha member said, adding, ""Hindutva is going to help the BJP."" Swamy said the ruling party had started honouring the promises it had made to the electorate, adding that it needed another five years to finish the task. ""I will not say that we have fulfilled all the promises we made in 2014, but we have started honouring them. We need five more years to complete what we have started,"" he said. Striking a controversial note ahead of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, which is scheduled to begin on 18 July, Swamy said some bureaucrats were ""sabotaging"" the government's good work. ""This is the first time we have had so many corrupt people being prosecuted. They may not have been convicted yet. We have had an invariant system for 70 years, due to which, today we find bureaucrats in our government sabotaging our work,"" he said. ""I had promised to reveal some names, but since the Parliament session is coming up, I am not going to give this opportunity to the Congress to use my statement against my own government,"" the BJP leader said. Stating that after the Parliament session, he would reveal the names at a public meeting in Mumbai, Swamy said, ""But by that time, (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi might even remove them, so I will not have to give those names."" Adding to Modi's recent comment that the Congress was like a ""bail gaadi"" now, punning on the legal term ""bail"" and the Hindi term for bullock carts, Swamy said the ""bail gaadi"" was headed to ""Tihar Vihar"" (jail). Hitting out at the Opposition party, he said according to  , Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had gone to the US Embassy in 2006 and told the officials there that his party had concluded that ""Hindu terror"" was more dangerous than the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). ""And they (Congress) did a somersault on the Samjhauta Express (blast). When the blast happened, the Manmohan Singh government wrote to the US saying it appeared to have been done by the LeT. ""The US, after collecting its own data, went to the UN and declared the LeT as a terrorist organisation,"" Swamy added. ""...and after the 26/11 attack in Mumbai, Chidambaram became the Union home minister and wrote a fresh FIR. We had two FIRs running at the same time (on the Samjhauta Express blast). ""One (FIR) which says the LeT had done it and in another, a celebrated military official (Colonel Prasad) Purohit — who was given the task to target and prepare a dossier on an Islamic terrorist — was picked up, tortured and jailed for nine years, because they wanted to prove that Hindu terror exists,"" the BJP leader alleged. Taking a swipe at Chidambaram, Swamy said he was teaching the senior Congress leader what ""real Hindu terror"" was. ""Now, of course, I am teaching Chidambaram what real Hindu terror is. Of course I won't be cruel, so I will send his wife, his son and daughter-in-law (to jail). I am not going to be cruel to the Congress party. I will send many to jail so their next working committee meet can take place in Tihar jail,"" he said sarcastically. Speaking about the country's economy, Swamy, an economist and statistician, said, ""The economy is certainly not in a very good state as I am not the finance minister."" Rooting for the removal of different types of cess, the BJP leader said the only cess that was needed and the one people would happily pay was for financing cow shelters. ""I am sure people will happily pay such a cess,"" he told the gathering in response to a query.",Press Trust of India
" West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday accused the BJP-led central government of ""hatching a conspiracy"" to drive out Bengalis from Assam by ""excluding"" their names from the first draft of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The NRC of 1951 is being updated in Assam under the supervision of the Supreme Court to identify original residents of the state in order to check illegal migration. Its first draft was published on 31 December midnight. Banerjee cautioned the Centre on the issue, saying it should not ""play with fire"". ""People have gone there (Assam) to work. In the name of NRC, they are planning to drive them out. I warn the BJP government at the Centre not to play with fire. They should not follow the divide and rule policy,"" she said while addressing a meeting here. ""This is a conspiracy of the central government to drive out around 1.80 crore people from the state,"" Banerjee alleged. She said that people migrate to other states for jobs which is their right. ""Slowly, they settle down just like there are people from other states who are working and staying in West Bengal,"" she said. She claimed that the Trinamool Congress is the only party which speaks for the cause of the people. ""We will continue speaking for the people and if anything happens to them, we will not keep silent,"" she said. The chief minister said that if trouble breaks out in Assam, it will have an effect on Bengal, but added: ""we will keep the Assamese residing in Bengal close to our bosom"".

"A Samajwadi Party MP likened Muhammad Ali Jinnah to Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru on Friday, 4 May as tension simmered at Aligarh Muslim University, the centre of a row over a portrait of the Pakistan founder. The administration suspended internet services in communally sensitive Aligarh district from 2 pm on 4 May to midnight 5 May to prevent “rumour-mongering”. AMU students continued their sit-in at the university's Baab-e-Syed gate, where they had clashed with the police on Wednesday, 3 May. They are boycotting classes for the next two days. Wednesday's clash took place when the students were demanding action against right-wing protesters who had entered the campus and wanted Jinnah's portrait removed from the student union office, where it has been hanging for decades. The students offered Friday prayers at the scene of the dharna in which a large number of teachers and other members of the AMU fraternity participated. In Gorakhpur, newly elected Samajwadi Party MP Praveen Nishad sparked a controversy by comparing the contribution of Gandhi and Nehru to that of Jinnah during the freedom struggle. Nishad had scored a surprise victory in the recent bypolls from Gorakhpur, represented by Yogi Adityanath before he became the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. During his Karnataka election tour, Adityanath said he was against honouring Pakistan's founder. Nishad today accused the BJP of “playing dirty politics' in Jinnah's name. “Nehru and Gandhi contributed for the freedom of the country but it cannot be denied that Jinnah equally contributed for it,"" he told reporters. He said the BJP was trying to ""divide the people in the name of religion and caste”. The Jinnah row started after BJP's Aligarh MP Satish Gautam wrote to AMU raising objections to the portrait. The University said portraits of all life members of the student union hang there. Jinnah, a founder member of the University Court, had also been given this honour before Partition. AMU vice chancellor Tariq Mansoor visited the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital on 4 May where three of the students injured in the police lathi-charge are being treated. AMU Teachers' Association (AMUTA) has sent a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind asking him to ""urgently institute"" a high-level judicial probe into the incident. They said members of certain outfits entered the campus and disrupted the peaceful academic environment there. AMUTA secretary Najmul Islam told PTI that they have urged the President to treat the matter seriously as it involved a breach in the security of former Vice President Hamid Ansari. Ansari was supposed to be felicitated at the University the day the violence broke out. Islam said protesters who had entered the campus were reportedly carrying firearms. He said the police, instead of preventing the hooligans from entering the campus, ""remained mute spectators"".       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Ambedkar, the grandson of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar who heads Bharip Bahujan Maha Sangh, said more than 50 organisations in Maharashtra think that they are ""deprived"" and are ready to fight the polls under the aegis of ""Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi"". ""In the run-up to the elections, we have formed this new front and ready to join hands with parties with progressive ideology if they are ready to field 10 candidates from Nomadic Tribes, Small OBC and Muslim community. ""If they are ready to accept our terms and conditions, we are ready to join hands with such parties,"" said Ambedkar while addressing a press conference in Pune. He specifically mentioned giving tickets to candidates from Dhangar (shepherd) community and Mali, an OBC caste. When asked whether he will join hands with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Dalit leader said the front's doors are open to all the progressive parties that are ready to accept our conditions. ""If the (front's) terms are conditions are not accepted by such progressive parties, we will fight all 48 seats on our own,"" he said. Ambedkar, however, said NCP chief Sharad Pawar's few steps were not progressive and asked the NCP to improve on that part. He said all the deprived and under-privileged classes in the country are coming together against the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP). ""All these communities have great anger against the BJP but they will not go with the Congress either. They are looking for some alternative and we are giving them that alternative,"" he said.

His name was considered but it was not possible to give him a ticket as he had lost elections twice in a row. May be he left because he got the hint. ""Apart from him, Shingda's name was also in reckoning. Now, we have no problem to recommend Shingda's name to the Parliamentary board.

On 2 June 1995, the combined anger of SP workers after the BSP’s announcement to withdraw from the coalition resulted in chaos at Lucknow’s Meerabai Guest House. The incident is considered one of the biggest deal-breakers between Mayawati and Mulayam. An unruly mob of SP workers marched into the Meerabai Guest House in Lucknow, where Mayawati was in a meeting with her MLAs.

""When the Congress was in power and Manmohan Singh was the prime minister, Pakistani terrorists used to infiltrate, explode bombs and go back,"" he said.

""So, when Gandhi issues a tweet after Donald Trump makes a pro-Pakistan statement, some ask what is this but many say 'what a refreshing style, let's listen to this guy'. So in many ways I would say, our politics is changing and Rahul Gandhi is leading and symbolising that change,"" he said. Tharoor also said that the Congress stands a good chance in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor once again left the country and its Twitterati stumped on 10 October after coining a new and unpronounceable word in his tweet, wherein he spoke about his new book,  Tharoor, who is often in news for his hold over English and his knowledge of obscure words, described his book as “ more than just a 400-page exercise in floccinaucinihilipilification.” According to the Oxford dictionary, the word is a noun and means ‘the action or habit of estimating something as worthless’. This is not the first time that Tharoor has left Twitter users in India scratching their heads with long-winding and not-so-common words. In December 2017, he used the word ‘rodomontade’, meaning boastful or inflated talk or behaviour. In February this year, he had tweeted the word ‘troglodytes’ in a response to Vinay Katiyar's comment on the Taj Mahal. The word left Twitter users amused, with many taking to the social networking platform to express their amusement and cracking jokes about Tharoor’s newest gift to the Twitterati. The outbreak of amusement and confusion led Tharoor to respond on Twitter on 11 October, apologising and adding another word. Tharoor’s latest challenge resulted in many parents trying to make their children pronounce the word and tweet videos. Young children joined the game, attempting to pronounce the word. Surprisingly, many of them nailed it as well! Tharoor replied to these efforts, appreciating them and their precociousness. Tharoor himself responded to the new trend, acknowledging the efforts of the children and apologising for “doing this to the young.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

As many as 5,000 district-level VHP workers who support Togadia have quit the right-wing outfit, Gujarat VHP spokesperson Jay Shah claimed. ""The entire Gujarat unit of the VHP is behind Togadia. That is why around 5,000 VHP workers and local leaders have already tendered their resignations.

" TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao will renew efforts to forge a non-NDA, non-UPA front after the Telangana Assembly election, a key party leader said on Monday. KT Rama Rao, the son of caretaker chief minister Chandrasekhar Rao, also took an aim at N Chandrababu Naidu for his attempts to bring together Opposition parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). ""Desperate times, they say, call for desperate measures,"" is how Rama Rao termed the efforts of Naidu, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister. In an interview to  , Rama Rao — KTR as he is referred to by many — alleged that Naidu was desperate because he was in a bad shape politically in his home state, where the Assembly election is due in 2019. ""He (Naidu) is trying to shift the blame of his failure of governance on to the central government. He wants to give an impression that he is fighting against (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi"", KTR said. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader said Naidu wants to paint Modi as a ""villain"" of this region, but KTR pointed out that Modi and the BJP were a ""non-entity"" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. ""It shows his (Naidu's) level of frustration,"" KTR said, describing the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president's moves to forge Opposition unity against the BJP as part of a cover-up for his ""failure"" as the chief minister. Naidu had recently met Congress president Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, JDS supremo HD Deve Gowda and DMK head MK Stalin, among others, as part of his efforts. Earlier, KCR had also met TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and Deve Gowda, among others, to prop up a non-Congress, non-BJP front. On a perception in some quarters that Chandrasekhar Rao's efforts on this front have failed, KTR said the aim of the TRS was not to garner power by forging opportunistic alliances. After 11 December, when the Assembly polls results will be declared, KTR asserted that Chandrasekhar Rao would come back as the chief minister and renew steps to build such a front. ""Our efforts to build a non-NDA, a non-UPA coalition will continue because it's in the larger interest of the country,"" Rama Rao said, alleging that both the Congress and the BJP had failed the country.

"Farmers' problems should be understood sensitively and practical solutions found for them, the RSS said on Sunday. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi said there was a need to change the agrarian policy and the government has to ensure that farmers get a proper price for their produce. However, he noted that there were a few obstacles in doing so. Replying to a query on farmers' issues, he said their problems should be understood sensitively and practical solutions found for them. ""No government can be insensitive on the questions related to farmers and it has to be sensitive towards farmers and find ways to address their problems. It is their job to think and find a solution,” Joshi told reporters at the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) of the RSS, the ruling BJP's ideological mentor. His remarks assume significance as they come against the backdrop of thousands of farmers from various districts of Maharashtra marching towards Mumbai to protest outside the state Assembly. Joshi said the farmers also need to change their mindset and while farming, they must keep government policies in mind. Replying to another question on the banking scams and the overall economic scenario, Joshi said these financial irregularities indicate that there are loopholes in the system. “Such incidents (banking frauds) are a big challenge and posing danger to the country,” he said, adding that the government and the financial institutions of the country should take them very seriously. He also suggested that the financial system should also be made more fool-proof. Speaking on the expansion of the Sangh, Joshi said the acceptability of the organisation has increased in the country. He, however, clarified that the increase in the RSS' acceptability has nothing to do with the BJP assuming power at the Centre.

"It is no surprise that the words 'master election strategist' often preface the latest JD(U) entrant Prashant Kishor's name. Known for running some of the most successful political campaigns in recent times, it is Kishor who steered Prime Minister Narendra Modi to victory in the 2012 Gujarat Assembly polls and, the more significant, 2014 Lok Sabha elections. On Sunday, Kishor formally joined the Janata Dal (United) at a party meeting in Patna, setting off murmurs among the party that Bihar chief minister and JD(U) chief   as his ""political successor"". Kishor, who recently said that he would not campaign for anyone in the 2019 elections, has in the past worked with the Bharatiya Janata Party, JD(U) and Congress on several electoral campaigns. Born in 1977, Kishor, a public health expert, spent eight years working at the United Nations before joining political parties to help with their campaigns. He is the former head of Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), which was later reformulated to Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC). His work with BJP during the 2014 general elections earned him the tag of being the ""most trusted strategist in the Narendra Modi organisation,"" according to  Here is a brief look at his journey across the various parties so far: Kishor's work with the BJP has been successful so far. After leading the saffron party, led by Modi, to a victory in the 2012 Gujarat Assembly election, he and his team at CAG took up the mantle of laying the ground to replicate Modi's win in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. If in retrospect, one hails Modi's use of social media to expand his voter base, the credit goes to Kishor. Influenced by former US president Barack Obama's use of social media and communication strategies during his presidential campaigns, the election strategist sought to bring in number crunchers, communication experts, media planners, technology, and surveyors to build the campaign, reported  It was Kishor's team that came up with ' ', simultaneous projection of Modi's speeches through hologram technology etc. However, several members of the BJP and RSS, including Amit Shah, felt Kishor's and his CAG did not play a significant role in BJP's victory, and that BJP's victory was more to the brand Modi had already created for himself. This led to Kishor's departure. It is believed he told Modi, ""When two brothers fail to get along, it is better for one of them to leave,"" as per the  report. A year later, Kishor and his IPAC team landed in Bihar, this time to tackle the 2015 Bihar Assembly election for Nitish Kumar. A native of Bihar, Kishor helped Kumar secure a third consecutive term in the state, defeating the BJP-led NDA. The saffron party failed even after Modi addressed nearly 31 election rallies in the state, according to  . Substituting Modi's  with  for Kumar's campaign, Kishor sought feedback from people on the government's performance over the previous decade. Kishor and his team came up with the campaign slogan "" "" and used vibrant colours of red and yellow on posters to people's attention. He also devised the  (Knock on every door) campaign to help party workers establish a closer connect with the masses, as per a  report. Some of the other initiatives that were undertaken were GPS enabled bicycles and deployment of women to campaign from door-to-door. As JD(U) won the elections that year, the BJP had to begrudgingly accept that while their party leaders were relentlessly criss-crossing Bihar and giving speeches, Kishor's resourceful campaign had helped cut through the fluff and connected with the people. In 2016, Kishor moved to Congress in Punjab to help Captain Amarinder Singh win the state Assembly polls. His electioneering machinery worked the magic again as Congress received a historic win. Kishor's team introduced the ' , along with 'Punjab da Captain' revolving around Singh. Party leaders said he   interactions of college students with Singh and appointed local 'kaptans' for the campaign. The Congress ended up bagging 77 seats in the 117-seat Assembly.

"Students at the Mumbai campus of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences on Monday, 7 May, held silent protests against the administration’s withdrawal of fee waivers to students from the SC, ST and OBC communities, even as the institute held its convocation programme. The students, who had reportedly decided to disrupt the convocation proceedings earlier, retracted their plan and instead held peaceful protests. Some students, including students’ union general secretary Fahad Ahmad, have also refused to collect their degrees on stage as a mark of protest. Ahmad told   that when he went on stage to collect his degree, he attempted to present a memorandum of their demands to S Ramadorai, the chairman of the governing board, who refused to take it. In retaliation, Ahmed refused to collect his degree. Archana, another student from TISS, said that the students who had denied their degrees on stage will collect it from the office at a later date. According to   students were handed a circular issued by the Registrar of the institute, requesting them to hold peaceful protests. Meanwhile, the students had reached a decision to hold a non-violent protest after a general body meeting on Sunday, 6 May. The students gathered around the convention centre with posters and banners, handing out badges that spelt ‘injusTISS.’ The students have been on protest since February, up in arms over the cancellation of the hostel and dining fee waivers that were earlier given to the marginalised communities. The notification also reportedly said that the students will be required to make the payment for the academic year 2018-19 upfront. Archana told   that while the administration had ceded to their demands in writing last month, announcing that SC/ST students would be required to pay Rs 4,500 while OBC students would be required to pay Rs 12,500. However, the latest notification does not reflect these promises. Speaking to  , PK Shahjahan, the dean of student affairs, said the convocation ceremony went smoothly. However, he said only one student had given up his degree certificate in protest. He also told   that while the amount to be paid was not mentioned on the TISS website, it had been made clear that if a student writes to the administration regarding their inability to pay the fees, the payment would be deferred. Meanwhile, the payment of fees has reportedly been postponed from 8 May to 11 May. However, postponing the date does not change anything as the administration is yet to answer the questions and demands posed by the students, said Archana. Archana, who is set to attend the convocation ceremony, said that she would not refuse her degree as she “had struggled long for it.” She will, nonetheless, wear a badge in solidarity with the protesting students.

": The BJP made light of the Congress's claim that the Opposition had the numbers to back its no-confidence motion against the government on Thursday. Asked about Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's claim that the Opposition had numbers, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar took a dig at her, saying, ""Sonia Gandhi's maths is weak."" Kumar also recalled that Gandhi, as the then Congress chief in 1999, had claimed to have the support of 272 MPs, the majority mark in the Lok Sabha, after the fall of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. Echoing similar sentiments, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said the government had the strength in the House to defeat the motion if one went by Indian mathematics and wondered if Sonia Gandhi knew some other mathematics. According to sources in the ruling party, it is confident of getting the support of as many as 314 MPs in the Lok Sabha, when the opposition-backed no-confidence motion is put to vote Friday. Going by the estimate of the BJP's floor managers, the government is likely to get the support of smaller parties outside the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) such as the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the Raju Shetty-led Swabhimani Paksha. Although the two parties are no longer part of the NDA, the government believes they would stand by it during the vote on the motion. BJP sources said the Narendra Modi-led government would get the support of 314 MPs in the Lower House, which has an effective strength of 533 at present.  The list of the 314 MPs, however, did not include the name of Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, who was also a BJP MP, they added. The majority mark in the Lok Sabha currently is 267. In a House of 533 members, the ruling NDA has 313 MPs, including 274 (including the speaker) of the BJP, 18 of the Shiv Sena, six of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and four of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The stated strength of the Opposition in the Lower House is 222, including 63 MPs of the Congress-led UPA, 37 of the AIADMK, 34 of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), 20 of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), 16 of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and 11 of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). Mahajan announced Thursday that the House would take up the debate on the no-confidence motion, moved by several opposition parties on issues such as a special category status to Andhra Pradesh, cow vigilantism, mob lynching, atrocities against women and Dalits and the alleged dilution of the SC/ST Act, on Friday (July 20). The speaker had not accepted the notices for a similar motion during the Budget Session, which was washed out due to a continued uproar by the TDP, TRS and some other opposition parties. The notices were rejected by Mahajan on the ground that the House was not in order as there were continuous protests in the Well by the opposition members on various issues. ",Press Trust of India
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lashed out at the Congress saying that one family had ruled the country for over four decades and asked the people to compare the dynasty-led governments with the ""development-oriented"" NDA. ""One family either directly or indirectly ruled the country for 48 years,"" he told a public meeting organised by the BJP, referring to the governments of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. On the other hand, he said, there was the NDA government which will complete 48 months this May. Intellectuals can debate the difference between what was achieved during the Congress regimes and the BJP-led NDA, he said. Targeting the Congress government in Puducherry, he said the union territory had poor infrastructure and was a victim of ""Congress culture"". Modi asserted that the BJP would win the coming Assembly elections in Karnataka and other states, and said the Congress would be left with only the V Narayanasamy government in Puducherry. He did not refer to the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab. ""I want to congratulate the Chief Minister of Puducherry because the Congress is going to exhibit him as a specimen after June,"" he said predicting the defeat of the Congress in the other states.

" Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday questioned whether former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee died on 16 August or if his death was announced that day to ensure that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence day speech was not disrupted. Raut, a Rajya Sabha member who is also the editor of the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', gave no explanation or reason for questioning the day of Vajpayee's death that was announced by AIIMS, which also gave his time of death on 16 August. ""Rather than our people, our rulers should first understand what is ' ' (self-rule). Vajpayee died on 16 August, but from 12-13 August, his condition was deteriorating. To avoid national mourning and lowering of flag to half-mast on Independence Day, and also (because) Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to make his elaborate speech from the Red Fort, Vajpayee left this world on 16 August (or his death was announced),"" Raut said. The article in Marathi is titled ""What is swarajya?"". Though Shiv Sena is an alliance partner of the BJP at the Centre as well as in Maharashtra, it has been taking swipes at the saffron party and Modi. Raut, in the article, said National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah shouted ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai""and ""Jai Hind"" at a condolence meeting for Vajpayee, and for this reason, he was manhandled in Srinagar. ""And the government shielded the culprits. This new kind of freedom has now emerged,"" the Sena MP wrote. ""When it is learnt that police have captured terrorists who had planned to carry out attacks in Delhi, it tells you that Independence Day is nearing. This tradition continued this year too. Ten terrorists who wanted to sabotage Independence Day celebrations were arrested. A huge cache of arms was seized. So (afterwards), the prime minister celebrated Independence Day fearlessly,"" Raut added. ""Prime Minister Modi made several announcements for the poor (in his Independence day speech). The tone of his speech suggested that previous governments did nothing, and so freedom (until now) had been wasted,"" Raut wrote. He said though the prime minister says people who take bribes are facing action, bribery has not decreased. ""..It is true that welfare schemes are run on the taxes which honest people pay. It is also true that the prime minister's foreign tours are funded by the same money, and thousands of crores are spent on advertisements from the same money.

"The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a contempt plea of the Tamil Nadu government against the Centre for not constituting the Cauvery Management Board (CMB). A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud posted the matter for April 9. “We understand Tamil Nadu’s difficulty of not getting water. We will resolve the issue. List the matter for April 9,” the bench said. Tamil Nadu had sought contempt action against the Centre for “failure” to frame the scheme for constitution of the Cauvery Management Board and the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee within six weeks, as directed by the apex court on February 16. Tamil Nadu, in its contempt plea, said the Centre was bound to give effect to the judgement by framing a scheme so that the authorities of – Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee – were put in place within six weeks. It said the authorities needed to be in place so that the decisions of the tribunal as modified by the apex court were implemented in accordance with the time schedule prescribed therein. The Centre, meanwhile, in its petition had said that since there were divergent views between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on the constitution of the CMB, the apex court should clarify whether “it is open to the central government to frame the scheme under 6A at variance with the recommendations contained in the report of the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal (CWDT) regarding the Cauvery Management Board”. Karnataka has opposed the constitution of the CMB and sought some alternative mechanism to implement the verdict. The Union government also said that considering the overall sensitivity of the issues involved, the apex court may also clarify whether it had any flexibility in modifying the composition of the CMB to “a mixture of administrative and technical body” and “not purely a technical body” as recommended by the CWDT for effective conduct of the business of the board. The apex court had on February 16 raised the 270 tmcft share of Cauvery water for Karnataka by 14.75 tmcft and reduced Tamil Nadu’s share, while compensating it by allowing extraction of 10 tmcft groundwater from the river basin, saying “the issue of drinking water has to be placed on a higher pedestal”. With the apex court’s verdict, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry would be annually entitled to 404.25 tmcft, 284.75 tmcft, 30 tmcft and 7 tmcft of Cauvery water, respectively out of the total of 740 tmcft of water. It had granted six weeks time to the Centre to formulate a scheme to ensure compliance of its 465-page judgement on the decades-old Cauvery dispute, and made it clear that it will no longer be extending time on the matter.

But it was his walk across the green-carpeted Well of House at the end to hug Modi that left almost everyone, not the least the prime minister, surprised. Modi shook Gandhi's hands but ignored his call to stand so that he could hug the BJP leader. The Congress chief, however, embraced him as he remained seated. Modi initially looked nonplussed and did not stand up to hug him, but recovered quickly and called Gandhi back and patted him on the back. He also appeared to say a few words, which were inaudible.

": Discontent is brewing in the Congress in Kerala over moves to give another term to PJ Kurien, whose Rajya Sabha tenure ends next month,with at least one young MLA opining that the upper house should not be seen as an 'old age home'. Three Rajya Sabha seats from the state, including the one held by Kurien, the deputy chairman, will fall vacant on 1 July. The young MLAs in the party from Kerala — VT Balram, Hibi Eden, Anil Akkara, Roji M John and Shafi Parambil have openly voiced their discontent against any move to give another chance to Kurien. In separate Facebook posts on Sunday, Congress MLA from Ernakulam, Hibi Eden, said the Upper house should not be seen as an 'old age home'. ""The party has turned into a consortium of leaders and more than party's interests, priority is now being given to personal preferences"", he said. ""New set of people should come instead of tried and tested old faces. People are yearning for new programmes, new techniques. If that change does not happen in the RS polls, it will isolate the party from the people, particularly from youngsters and women"", Eden said. The leaders who wish to remain in office till their end are a 'curse' to the party, Roji M John, who represents Angamally in Ernakulam district in the assembly, said in another post. ""The situation is similar with regard to many other party positions also. If the party is not prepared to change, then lakhs of workers who love this organisation will not remain silent and that is the message that is being heard since the past few days"", he said, apparently referring to the recent drubbing the Congress-UDF received in the Chengannur bypoll. D Vijayakumar of Congress had lost by 20,956 votes over winning candidate Saji Cheriyan of CPM in the bypoll. In a post laced with sarcasm, another MLA, Anil Akkara said 'the party should not trouble Kurien any more by giving him huge responsibilities"". Balaram, the Thrithala MLA, said Kurien should declare on 
his own that he was not for another term in the Upper House and hoped that the senior leader would use this opportunity judiciously to bid adieu to parliamentary politics. His services as Union minister and Deputy chairman would always be remembered, Balram said. Seventy seven-year-old Kurien was a Lok Sabha MP from 1980-1999 and was elected to the Rajya Sabha in July 2005. He was elected deputy chairman in August 2012. Reacting to the criticism, Kurien said he had never hankered after party positions and was prepared to stay away if the party asked him to do so. When the opinions raised by the MLAs were brought to his attention, Kurien told television channels that the party comprises both young and senior leaders. It was the Congress which had given him all the posts and he was made MP after working for 25 years for the party, he said. The Election Commission had recently announced biennial polls to three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala, including the one held by Kurien, falling vacant on 1 July. The election will be held on June 21. Besides Kurien, Joy Abraham (Kerala Congress-M) and CP Narayanan (CPM) will retire on 1 July.",PTI
" A mistake was made in including the name of a living person in the list of ""Hindu martyrs"" sent to the union home minister, BJP's Lok Sabha member Shobha Karandlaje said on Sunday, blaming Congress for trying to revive an ""old issue"" over which she had expressed regret. ""I had expressed my regret at this lapse last year. I had mistakenly included Ashok Pujari's name in the list of BJP and RSS workers who were killed after Siddaramaiah assumed charge as chief minister."" ""I had brought this mistake to the notice of the central government,"" she told   over phone. Karandlaje, an MP from Chikkamagaluru-Udupi, was locked in a controversy after reports emerged about her having included Pujari's name in the list of '23 Hindu martyrs', which she sent to Home Minister Rajnath Singh on 8 July, 2017, demanding an NIA probe into the killings of RSS/BJP workers in Karnataka. A controversy had broken in July 2017 itself over her faux pas, for which she had expressed regret. Pujari, who lives in a remote village in Udupi district, was attacked by masked people on 20 September, 2015 and hospitalised. He had recovered after about a month. Targeting the Siddaramaiah government over being ""soft"" on ""Jehadi forces"", the BJP has made the killings of Hindu activists a major issue in its political discourse. Karandlaje said even former deputy chief minister R Ashoka had admitted that there was mistake in the list which was brought to the notice of the central government in 2017. Asked who were behind raking up the old issue, Karandlaje said it is the ""malafide intentions"" of Congress to raise this old issue to divert the people's attention from the'unholy electoral understanding' between Congress and SDPI-PFI. ""The Congress wants to divert the issue of their unholy electoral understanding with SDPI and PFI. Therefore, they areraking up this old issue,"" she said. Social Democratic Party of India is the political wing of Popular Front of India, an Islamic outfit. Karandlaje said that instead of politicising the issue, Congress leaders should visit Pujari, who was ""nearly killed"" and try to help him.",PTI

" Union Minister Arun Jaitley Saturday said mahagathbandhans in India are tried, tested and failed, saying if such an alliance is formed again then 2019 will be a contest between a stable government led by a strong leader and an ""anarchic combination"".

Giving historical accounts of mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in India, Jaitley said, ""You tried it under Chandra Shekhar, it was partly tried under VP Singh, it was tried under Charan Singh and it was tried under IK Gujaral and Devi Gowda. It's an experiment where policy gets killed and the longevity of the government is a few months."" ""So, these (mahagathbandhans) are tried, tested and failed ideas much that they sound very fancy. In order to have a big alliance, you must have a large nucleus and smaller groups aligned around them. You cannot have a nucleolus of a handful of people and you cannot have an alliance of political parties whose interests are regional,"" the finance minister said at the HT Leadership Summit in New Delhi. Jaitley's comments have come in the run-up to the upcoming assembly polls in some major states and also the Lok Sabha elections. These remarks assume significance amidst talk of formation of a grand alliance of opposition parties to defeat the BJP in 2019. He further said ""you cannot have an alliance with parties whose leaders are maverick or they want to be in an alliance to have criminal cases to be closed. If you get together this kind of a crowd then 2019 will be a choice between a stable government with a strong leader versus a completely anarchic combination"". Observing that history had provided India with a great opportunity, he said, India has been growing fast consistently despite the global slowdown and other factors. ""So, therefore, this is when we need coherence, governance and policy. This is not the time where you can go in for an anarchic kind of combination. I think aspirational societies never commit suicide. So, I am very clear what will happen in 2019,"" he said. Dismissing Congress President Rahul Gandhi's allegation that the Narendra Modi- led government is responsible for mounting bad loans in the banking sector, Jaitley said, ""I think some people need to grow up and understand these issues. Debate on these issues has to be a grown-up debate."" The total amount of debt given till 2007-08 was about Rs 18 lakh crore by public sector banks in the country and when the global slowdown began this Rs 18 lakh crore went up to Rs 55 lakh crore in 2014, he said. Year after year, he said, the previous UPA government was asking banks to grow their lending by 31 percent. ""So the undeserving and unstable projects were all been funded. That's when the bank loot started. So the Congress president must realise that this was the genesis of the problem,"" he said. The second crime that they committed was instead of accepting the problem of additional capacity, banks were asked to roll over the debt when the borrower started defaulting, he said. Citing an example of Vijay Mallya without taking his name, Jaitley said: ""in one of the most controversial cases where a person has escaped to the UK, it was the RBI which wrote to the SBI to please give him (Mallya) the second restructuring"". So you have managed the system to such an extent that the RBI telling State Bank of India that someone should be given a second restructuring, he added.

"Launching a fresh round of agitation against the BJP government in Gujarat, Hardik Patel staged a day-long sit-in for Patidar quota in Morbi district on Tuesday. The 25-year-old leader and his associates in the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) sat on   from 11 am to 5 pm at Bagathala village, demanding loan waiver for farmers and reservation for the Patidar community. He also demanded immediate release of PAAS member Alpesh Kathiria, who was arrested last month in a sedition case registered by police against Hardik Patel and others. Hardik had sat on a hunger strike for demands of loan waiver and Patidar quota from August 25 to September 12 this year. With today’s protest, organised on the 149th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, he seemed to have started another round of agitation. He said he would stage sit-ins across Gujarat and hold a huge gathering of farmers in Morbi district in the next two to three months. Farmers should cease to be slaves of the government and support his movement, he said. “Time has come for farmers to come together. I need your support, because my fight is for you,” Hardik said, claiming that five farmers committed suicide in Gujarat in the the last seven days alone. Justifying the demand of reservation, he claimed that bright students from the Patidar community are deprived of government jobs or admission to medical colleges. Farmers should seek government jobs for their children because farming is no longer profitable, he said. “If you have two children, then aim to make one of them a government officer. There is no point in making both of them continue in farming,” the Patidar leader said.",PTI

Gohil claimed that Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was planning to appoint parliamentary secretaries to appease some disgruntled BJP MLAs who could not find place in the ministry. The governor must not give his assent for these appointments as the post is unconstitutional and it will amount to a contempt of court, the Congress leader said. The Supreme Court, in its 26 July, 2017 order, had held that a state government has no right to appoint a parliamentary secretary, Gohil said. ""To contain dissatisfaction in his party, the chief minister, despite being aware of the Supreme Court's order, is talking about appointing a number of parliamentary secretaries which is against Constitution and will amount to a contempt of court,"" the Congress leader said.

" A staunch RSS ideologue, a hard boiled organisation man, Bengaluru's ""most loved"" MP and the first person to speak in Kannada in the United Nations are some of the connotations associated with Union Minister Ananth Kumar. Known for his political adroitness, Kumar, a six-time member of Parliament, gregarious with strong political instincts, had managed to be in the inner circle of the central leadership of the BJP — be it during the heyday of Atal Bihari Vajpayee or L K Advani and now Narendra Modi. Born in a middle class Brahmin family on July 22, 1959, in Bengaluru to Narayan Shastri, a railway employee, and Girija N Shastry, his early education began under the guidance of his mother who herself was a graduate. Graduate in Arts and Law, Kumar's journey into public life began due to his association with the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student organisation of the Sangh Pariwar, which he served in various capacities, including the state secretary and the national secretary. Kumar had even demonstrated against the then Indira Gandhi government's imposition of Emergency and had also got imprisoned for it for about 30 days. With his steady political growth, his association with the Sangh, where he was mentored politically, also grew stronger. Looking for bigger ground in politics, Kumar joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1987, where he went on to to take up the responsibilities of state secretary, state president of the Yuva Morcha, general secretary and national secretary. Along with the then state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa, Kumar is among a few party leaders who can be credited for the growth of BJP in Karnataka, as they built the party from the scratch, which paved the way for the installation of the first ever saffron party government in the South. Kumar began his parliamentary career when he got elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 from Bangalore South, the constituency which remained his strong fort till his passing sway, by winning it for six consecutive times. He enjoyed the credit of being the ""youngest"" minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet in 1998. He served as the Civil Aviation minister, also Minister for Tourism, Sports, Youth Affairs & Culture, Urban development & poverty alleviation. Kumar, who also held positions in various parliamentary committees, was serving as the Union Cabinet Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Chemicals and Fertilizers in the Narendra Modi led government, after winning the 15th Lok Sabha election from Bengaluru south by defeating IT Czar Nandan Nilekani. He is widely credited for implementing Neem Coated Urea and setting up of Jan Aushadhi Kendras with focus on affordable quality health care. While being the all important member of the BJP's parliamentary board, Kumar is often regarded as the ""Delhi face"" of the Karnataka BJP and also for the state government who could be counted upon for taking issues concerning Karnataka. He is known to have had politically hostile relationship with Yeddyurappa on occasions and often faced accusations of meddling too much in Karnataka affairs, when the the Lingayat strongman was at the helm of affairs in the state as its Chief Minister.

"Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy told his party workers during a celebratory ceremony in Bengaluru’s Seshadripuram on Saturday, 14 July, that he was “not happy being the chief minister”. He said, ""I have swallowed poison like Lord Vishakantha. You all are happy that I became the CM. But I'm not.” Kumaraswamy was speaking at the party programme organised to felicitate him for waiving off farm loans. “It is true that I wished to become the Chief Minister of this state before the elections and promised people so many things. The people are now happy but I'm not happy being the CM,” Kumaraswamy said. Kumaraswamy announced a conditional waiver on farmer loans, setting aside Rs 34,000 crore in the first Budget presented by the JD(S)-Congress coalition government at the Vidhana Soudha on Thursday, 12 July. However, the loan waiver comes with a few conditions. The CM said that only loans up to Rs 2 lakh per farming family will be waived. Also, the waiver is only on institutional credit and loans taken from private money lenders will not be waived. The reason behind this, he explained, was that after speaking to the people concerned in the agricultural sector, he found out that large landholding farmers had taken loans as high as Rs 40 lakh. “In this background, as per the opinion of the farming community, it is not right to waive higher-value crop loan; I have decided to limit the loan amount to Rs 2 lakh. Due to this crop loan waiver scheme, farmers will get benefit of Rs 34,000 crore,” the Budget text read. Responding to Kumaraswamy’s emotional statement, the Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka, G Parameshwara told ANI: “How can he say that? He must be definitely happy; CM has to be always happy. If he's happy, we'll all be happy.” Senior Congress member Mallikarjun Kharge also gave a response. “You have to face problems.

" The BJP on Sunday demanded the sacking of Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir, claiming that he was seen in a video terming the police probe in the Kathua rape-and-murder case motivated and defending the public protests against it. Citing the BJP's decision to remove two of its  , who had joined the public protests against the probe, Union minister Prakash Javadekar wondered if Congress president Rahul Gandhi would only point fingers at others but maintain silence on the comments of his party's Jammu and Kashmir unit chief. In the video, which was played during a press conference at the BJP headquarters here, Mir is purportedly telling reporters that the locals believed the investigation was motivated and that the main culprits were still at large. Questions would be raised and there must be some justification for the people's demand, Mir said, wondering if the probe was aimed at making some political points. ""When our ministers expressed these sentiments, the Congress, the media made a lot of noise. We took action. They resigned. Now we want to ask Rahul Gandhi, who took out a candlelight march (protesting the growing incidents of crime against women in the country), why is he not taking action against his party's state president,” Javadekar said. Pointing fingers at others while protecting its own was the character of the Congress party, he alleged. The authenticity of the video could not be independently verified by  . The BJP had faced flak after its leaders in the Jammu region, including two ministers in the   government, joined the public protests against the police probe into the brutal rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl from the nomadic Bakarwal Muslim community that had led to the arrest of eight persons. The two ministers — Chaudhary Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga — resigned on Friday, soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said these incidents, including a rape case in which a BJP MLA from Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh is the accused, had shamed the country and that justice would be ensured in all the cases. Javadekar also demanded an apology from senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, noting that Bar Association of Jammu president B S Slathia, who had led the public protests against the police probe, was his poll agent in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. The BJP leader also questioned Gandhi's candlelight march at India Gate on Friday night, saying he never protested against the ""Nirbhaya"" incident, atrocities against Dalits in Mirchpur in Haryana and many other incidents of rape that had happened during the Congress rule. ""People can see what kind of politics you (Gandhi) are doing. Why are you silent? You should immediately sack him (Mir),"" Javadekar said. The HRD minister rued that there had been no gender sensitisation for men in the country for generations, claiming it to be a reason behind the heinous crimes against women, and said, ""No amount of condemnation is enough for such incidents."" Reacting to Congress leader  's comment that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should be beaten with slippers, Javadekar said the BJP condemned such remarks and claimed that the Opposition party was making provocative statements and trying to incite violence as it was afraid of losing the 12 May Karnakata Assembly polls.

He further asserted that mining baron Janardhana Reddy has nothing do with BJP, and that ""it is final."" 3)   Labelling the Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka "" since Independence, Shah cited figures to claim that the state failed to use massive funds allotted by the Centre. ""They say Centre has not done us any favour by granting funds. I agree to that. We have not done anybody a favour and given the people of Karnataka their rights, but what have you done by not using the funds properly. You (Congress) have done the work of taking away the rights of the people,"" Shah said. 4)   ""The agenda in this election is development, governance and the politics of performance,"" Shah said on a query about  .

" Ashutosh Bhardwaj Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram has stressed the fact that the government seems to have no answer for many questions with regard to the Rafale deal. In an interview with   Sanjay Pugalia, Chidambaram said that they have no problem with private companies doing business in this country and that “the issue is very different in Rafale.” Chidambaram stressed that there should be a concrete reason for why the earlier MoU was cancelled, just as there is a proper reason why someone moves houses – a leak, for instance, or a neighbourhood which is not proper. Chidambaram pointed out that the Air Force needs seven squadrons – 126 aircraft, which Dassault is ready to sell. If the price is indeed 9-20 percent cheaper, as the government has claimed, then what is the reason for buying only 36 aircrafts? Chidambaram questioned why the government did not ask Dassault to choose HAL, especially since the latter has 70 years of experience and has built Sukhoi, Mirage, MiGs and now its own Tejas. Chidambaram also questioned how the defence minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) could say that she had no information about Dassault entering into an agreement with a private sector company, when on the same day that she met French Defence Minister Florence Parly, the latter flew to Nagpur to lay the foundation stone of an event attended by Mr Gadkari, Mr Fadnavis, the French ambassador to India and the chairman of Dassault.

"Voters in the United States headed to the polls on Tuesday in crucial mid-term elections that will determine if President Donald Trump’s Republican Party is able to retain control of the House of Representatives and the Senate,   reported. Elections to 36 state gubernatorial posts and state legislatures are also being held. Polling will close at 4.30 am on Wednesday (Indian time) in the eastern states and at 11.30 am in the westernmost parts of Alaska. In Congress, Americans will elect all 435 members of the House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to win control of the House but are at a disadvantage in the Senate, where a number of incumbents are defending their seats in states where Trump won the presidential polls. Both Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday warned about the threat of voter fraud, echoing the president’s claim that massive voter fraud had marred his 2016 election. Trump had formed a commission to study the matter after he took office. But states refused to turn over voter data and it was disbanded soon after.  “Law enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any illegal voting which may take place in Tuesday’s election (or early voting),” the US president tweeted on Monday. “Anyone caught will be subject to the maximum criminal penalties allowed by law. Thank you!” In a statement, Sessions talked about the Justice Department’s plans to monitor ballot access and said “fraud in the voting process will not be tolerated”. Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday’s Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you! Voting rights advocates told   that these remarks were attempts to intimidate voters ahead of the elections. Republicans, they alleged, curtail voting access with rules that disproportionately affect voters of colour, who tend to vote for Democrats. “I find this kind of conduct incredibly anti-patriotic,” said Kristen Clarke of a voting rights group called Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “At a time when we need our White House and Justice Department speaking out against the relentless campaign of voter suppression in this election cycle, it defies reason.”  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016,   it was time for Americans to say “enough” after two years of watching the Trump administration “attack and undermine our democratic institutions and values”. Clinton urged the electorate to “vote against radicalism, bigotry, and corruption” and support “fantastic candidates all over the country – including a historic number of women”. If they win, they’ll do great things for America. Let's exercise our birthright as Americans today, put those people in office, and continue the hard work of saving our democracy.  It'll take all of us. Happy Election Day.",Scroll Staff
" Assam Trinamool Congress (TMC) president Dwipen Pathak and two other party leaders resigned Thursday in protest against party supremo Mamata Banerjee's opposition to the final draft of the NRC, which has evoked a sharp reaction from different parties and organisations in the state. Pathak's resignation came within hours of a TMC delegation arriving at the Silchar airport in the Bengali-dominated Barak valley at Banerjee's instructions and being stopped from exiting it by the police. Diganta Saikia, a TMC leader from Golaghat and who was among the three to resign, even threatened to file a case against Banerjee for taking an anti-Assamese stand. The ruling BJP as well as other parties in Assam said the TMC had no existence in the Barak valley. Pathak, a former MLA from Hajo, told reporters here that he had apprised the party leaders of the ""ground realities"" in Assam after the publication of the final draft of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and urged Banerjee not to send the delegation to the north-eastern state now. ""The party did not pay heed to my suggestion and refused to understand the ground situation here. In this backdrop, it is not possible for me to remain in a party that does not value the Assamese sentiment,"" Pathak, who was a TMC MLA from 2011 to 2016, said. ""The TMC has no existence in Assam,"" he added. TMC leader Pradip Pachani of Sibsagar and Saikia resigned, saying they could not remain members of a party that wanted to compromise the identity of the indigenous Assamese people. The TMC delegation that arrived at Silchar was restricted to the Kumbhirgram airport as the district administration did not allow the leaders to enter the town, where prohibitory orders under Section 144, CrPC, were in force since last night. Effigies of Banerjee were burnt in Charaideo and Sonitpur districts in the Brahmaputra Valley by students' organisations, who warned the TMC supremo and her party not to ""meddle in Assam"". Banerjee's effigies were burnt by the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Parishad, Asomiya Yuva Sanmilani and All Tai Ahom Students' Union, the police said. Congress MLA from the Karimganj (North) constituency in Barak valley Kamalakhya De Purkayastha spoke against the turning away of the TMC delegates at the airport. ""The TMC has many wrong notions about the NRC and they (delegates) should have been allowed to come here, so that their misconceptions about the draft were cleared,"" he told  . ""We do not want the prevailing peace in Barak Valley to be disturbed at any cost. But turning the TMC delegates away from the airport was not a right thing to do,"" he said. Most political parties in the Barak valley too maintained that there was no sense of panic among the people and that Banerjee was ""trying to use the issue to gain a political entry to Assam"". State Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya, who represents the Dholai constituency in the valley, said Banerjee was trying to ""mislead and create confusion here, but the people have ignored it"". ""She has no idea about the ground realities in Assam and is trying to complicate the issue.... The TMC has no existence in Barak Valley and they are trying to use the NRC to make an entry as well as gain political mileage,"" he added. Former BJP MP Kabindra Purkayastha said, ""We are at a loss to understand why the TMC delegation wants to come to Assam when the people are not complaining."" There was no confusion or panic among the people as they were aware that they could make claims and seek corrections to the NRC, he said, adding that moreover, the TMC should be aware that the NRC was updated under the Supreme Court's supervision and the government had no hand in it. A senior police officer said the situation in the Barak Valley and the rest of Assam was peaceful and no NRC-related incident was reported so far. ""The people of the state are aware that this is not the final NRC list, but its final draft,"" he added.",Press Trust of India
" The Delhi BJP has begun serious parleys on the possibility of bypolls to 20 Assembly segments after the Election Commission's recommendation to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs for holding offices of profit. The BJP leaders discussed the issue in a meeting of the party's core committee members on Friday night, party sources said. ""The matter was discussed in detail along with other issues like the sealing drive underway in north and south Delhi,"" said a senior party leader who attended the meeting. The ruling AAP had bagged an impressive 67 seats in the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections. Since then, two by-elections were held in which the ruling party and the BJP got one seat each.

"Two videos purportedly shot by Shambhu Lal Regar, an  , from inside a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, have gone viral. In the videos he claims to be facing threats to his life from an inmate, and justifies his killing of a labourer from West Bengal over ""love jihad"". Regar, who is lodged in the Central Jail in Jodhpur after   Mohammad Afrazul from West Bengal in December last year, named the inmate as Vasudev, an accused in the The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances(NDPS) Act, 1985. Vasudev hails from West Bengal, claimed Regar. In one of the videos, Regar claims that the issue of ""love jihad"" has become ""serious"" and accuses the West Bengal government of not doing enough about it. Rajasthan Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria said they were investigating how Regar got access to a mobile phone inside the jail. Regar had killed Afrazul while, in a video, ranting against ""love jihad"", a term used by sections of Hindu activists to describe marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men. In the latest video, Regar said he was ""infuriated"" over a ""jihadist comment"", targeting Hindu women, and that was why he had killed Afrazul. The Jodhpur Central Jail administration said it had launched an ""intense search operation"" to find out how Regar was able to make the videos using a cell phone. According to a preliminary investigation, Regar could have used the cell phone of another inmate, but the jail authorities have failed to recover a mobile from the said inmate. Jail Superintendent Vikram Singh said they were investigating the matter and had also reviewed the security of Regar. Singh said the presence of mobile phones inside the jail was a ""serious matter"" and added that the prison authorities were trying to find out how the phones were making their way into the prison. Regar was arrested from Rajsamand district of Rajasthan. His act of killing Afrazul, and filming the act with the help of his teenage nephew, had created nationwide outrage in December 2017.

"RJD Chief Lalu Yadav’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti on Monday, 8 October, acknowledged the “rift” between her two brothers – Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav – but later clarified that despite all differences, the party was a “big family”. Latching onto her statement, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that Bharti’s admittance of infighting in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) would lead to the collapse of the party and its dynasty politics. Addressing party workers in Maner on the outskirts of Patna, Bharti asked them to give up bickering and stay united. “We are not lacking in support base. The challenge is to keep our flock together,” she added. However, Bharti later claimed that her call for unity among party workers was presented in a distorted manner. Taking to Twitter she said: ""My appeal to party workers to forget their differences and unite in the larger interest of the party is being distorted and presented out of context,"" she tweeted. Maner falls in the Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat from where Bharti had made an unsuccessful electoral debut in 2014. She got elected to the Rajya Sabha later. ""The time has come for you all to give up small differences and brace for the bigger challenges and do not give our opponents a chance to exploit the situation,"" she said. State BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said, ""Misa Bharti has admitted what we all know. The RJD will crumble because of the infighting within the family that controls the party."" ""The BJP has been fighting against the politics of dynastic rule and corruption. The RJD embodies these evils and it will meet its fate"", Anand said.

" The BJP trained its guns on National Conference (NC) president   on Sunday for suggesting that the LoC be converted into a ""Line of Peace and Goodwill"" and alleged that the Opposition party in Jammu and Kashmir had no ideology and only believed in arousing passions by playing with people's emotions for vote-bank politics. “Knowing fully well that there are no takers for Azadi south of Pir Panjal, Abdullah has very cleverly changed his stance by demanding that the Line of Control (LoC) be converted into a Line of Peace, thus making it amply clear that his party has no ideology and only believes in arousing passions by playing with people's emotions for vote-bank politics,” state BJP spokesperson Anil Gupta said in a statement. Gupta, a former army officer, was reacting to Abdullah's statement at Mandi in Poonch district on Saturday, suggesting the conversion of the LoC into a ""Line of Peace and Goodwill"" and cautioning the Centre against taking the people of Jammu and Kashmir for granted and ignoring their legitimate aspirations. “The NC has survived as a political party by posing itself as the well-wisher of the Kashmiri-speaking Muslims. It has always been wary of losing prominence due to the challenge posed by the other Muslims like Paharis, Punjabis, Gujjars and Shias in general and the Muslims of the erstwhile Jammu province in particular,” Gupta alleged. The BJP leader claimed that the same fear continued to haunt Abdullah and his party leadership even today and that was why, rather than uniting the population living across the LoC, he advocated it to be made a permanent border. “It was for the same reason that his father, Sheikh Abdullah, had forced former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to announce a unilateral ceasefire, when the invaders were on the run and the Indian Army was well poised to recapture the areas of Mirpur, Kotli, Poonch, and Muzaffarabad. “Had Muzaffarabad been recaptured, the strategic areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, Hunza and other frontier districts would have automatically returned to India as all the lines of communication to these areas passed through Muzaffarabad. It would also have saved the state from the problem of refugees, which haunts it to date,” he said. Gupta claimed that the NC's “dislike for non-Kashmiri speaking Muslim leaders was evident from the fact that when Mirza Afzal Beg resigned from the Maharaja's cabinet in 1945 due to differences within the party, the Maharaja had appointed Mian Ahmed Yar, an NC leader, ""but he was, however, expelled from the party because his presence in the council of ministers was not acceptable to Sheikh Abdullah as Yar was a non-Kashmiri speaking Muslim from Jammu”. As regards the return of the Haji Peer pass and Chhamb sector by Pakistan, he asked Abdullah to question his ally, the Congress, “which not only betrayed the people of the state but also belittled the sacrifices of the Indian Army by returning to Pakistan the territories captured by it”. “Had the strategic Haji Peer pass been in our possession today, there would have been no Uri-Poonch bulge and no question of Pakistan launching a proxy war against us as it would have provided a direct link between Poonch and the Kashmir Valley via Uri,” the BJP leader said.",PTI

"Taking cue from the Lingayat community, which was recently accorded minority status by the Karnataka government, the state’s Kodava community has now placed a similar demand. On Wednesday, 21 March, two members from the Kodava community- MM Bansy and Vijay Muthappa submitted a memorandum before the state minorities department regarding the same. The memorandum has reportedly been forwarded to the minorities commission. According to a   report, the memorandum states that since the Kodavas are a community with a mere 1.5 lakh population, with their own language, they too should be given the minority tag. The Kodavas are a martial race native to the Kodagu region in Karnataka. The Kodava thakk language, which is script-less, is being considered by the Centre for inclusion in the Eight Schedule of the Constitution. BJP MP Subramanian Swamy reportedly visited the Kodagu hills and supported their demands for a separate minority tag, while asserting that he would soon introduce a private member’s bill in the parliament regarding their autonomy. The TOI report states that the memorandum submitted by the two representatives mentioned that the community ‘did not follow many of the Hindu customs, and had it’s own distinct costumes.’ Speaking to TOI, the president of the Kodagu Natural Sciences Society, Lt Gen BC Nanda supported the community’s demand for a minority status. He said that the Kodavas had resided in Kodagu for over 2,000 years, and was declared a ‘C’ state after independence. In 1956, it became a part of Karnataka. Incidentally, the Karnataka government had earlier attempted to grant the community a tribal status following the submission of a memorandum by the Codava National Council.
