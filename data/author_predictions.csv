" The Shiv Sena will abstain from voting on the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha moved by the Opposition against the Modi government, party sources said on Friday. On Thursday, the Sena's chief whip in the Lok Sabha Chandrakant Khaire issued a whip to MPs asking them to be present in the House when the motion was discussed and support the government. Hours after issuing the whip, the Sena shifted its stance and said party chief Uddhav Thackeray had asked his party MPs to remain in Delhi and a final decision on supporting the Modi government would be taken on Friday morning before the debate started. ""Sena MPs have been asked to remain absent by Uddhav   during the voting on the no-confidence motion,"" a close aide of the Sena chief told  . Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu had sought the support of other parties for the motion, citing the NDA government's ""non-fulfilment of the promise"" to grant special status to his state.",Press Trust of India,PTI
"Disgruntled BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha, who has been a vocal critic of the current BJP leadership, said that he would not leave the party on his own but if he is ousted, he would not challenge the party’s “wisdom”. He, along with former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who quit the BJP recently alleging that there was a ""threat"" to democracy under the current dispensation led by the party, hit out at the Narendra Modi government over a number of issues at a ‘meet-the-press’ programme in Chandigarh. In an apparent reference to Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, Shatrugan said, ""Everyone knows it is a one-man show and a two-men army... One reason they are not showing me the door is that I have a clean image and have been winning elections by record margins. ""I want to ask that if I say demonetisation had adversely hit various sections of the society, particularly the poor, what is wrong in saying so."" The MP from Patna Sahib in Bihar said those in the BJP should be happy that at least someone from the party was saying so, ""because if you look at the rest, they have become yes-men. They are in a state of terror"". Yashwant Sinha said, an atmosphere of dejection was prevailing among the people of the country, who were feeling let down by the unfulfilled promises made by the government. Sinha had launched a political action group called the Rashtra Manch earlier this year to bring together politicians from across party lines to take on the ruling regime. He added that in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Modi government would be judged on how much it had delivered on those promises and not on ""what happened during Pandit (Jawaharlal) Nehru's or Indira Gandhi's or Manmohan Singh's time"". Yashwant Sinha said the current BJP was no longer the same outfit as it used to be during the time of leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani. On the political developments post the Karnataka Assembly polls, Sinha said gone were the times when the BJP used to actually hold a moral high ground in such situations. He added that former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Shanta Kumar had once recalled an incident from 1982, when Vajpayee had told the BJP leadership in the state not to stake claim to form the government, after the saffron outfit ended up winning 29 seats in the 68-member Assembly and also had the support of six Independents, as against the Congress's tally of 31 seats, lest the impression went out that the party was indulging in any kind of horse-trading. Referring to Shatrughan Sinha, he added, ""You are absolutely right in saying that the two persons who control the party are nowhere near, either in stature or moral standings, when compared to Atalji and Advaniji."" Replying to a question, the former Union finance minister said, ""I want to make it clear that Modi is not the issue. Nobody has anything personal against him. But we are witnessing certain trends in the country which are not healthy and that causes a lot of anxiety for the future of our country and society. ""The threat to the institutions, values and conventions of democracy, which are very firmly established. Parliament, the Supreme Court, the Election Commission, the agencies of the government like the Income Tax department, ED (Enforcement Directorate) and even the media – these are the institutions of democracy. If these are compromised, everything will be lost,"" he added. Asked if a united opposition would be able to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Sinha said, ""It is simple arithmetic. If you look at the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP, despite its 282 seats, had only 31 percent of the votes. The rest had 69 percent. If that 69 percent unites and the anti-incumbency factor works on the 31 percent, then the 69 percent has better chances."" Pointing out that in Uttar Pradesh, rival parties like the SP and the BSP had joined hands for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls and so had the SP, BSP and RLD for the upcoming Kairana bypoll, he said the country's politics was witnessing rapid changes. To another question on the country's economy, Sinha said he did not believe the figures put out by the Modi government.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" The Congress would emerge as the ""number one party"" in the Karnataka Assembly elections, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Sunday, taking a swipe at the BJP for mobilising the ""entire central machinery"" for state campaigns. He also said the understanding between the BJP and his party for the upcoming Legislative Council polls in Maharashtra didn't mean the Sena would forge an alliance with it in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in 2019. ""Whenever there are Assembly polls, the entire central machinery and chief ministers of all BJP-ruled states go there (to campaign), leaving the administration of the country and of their own states in the lurch. The country is watching all this,"" Raut told   in an interview. Slamming Yogi Adityanath, the Sena's Rajya Sabha MP said the seriousness with which the Uttar Pradesh chief minister took his duties became evident when he was seen campaigning in Karnataka while his own state reeled under a dust storm. ""Does the central leadership (of the BJP) not trust its own men in states? Why does Prime Minister Narendra Modi need to address dozens of campaign rallies when he is needed in Delhi to govern the country?"" asked Raut, whose party is in alliance with the BJP in Maharashtra and at the Centre. Though an ally, the Sena has been continuously criticising the BJP and its governments in states and at the Centre. ""There is a `dust storm' in Karnataka today. Once it clears, the Congress will emerge as the number one party. People have started listening to Rahul Gandhi now,"" Raut added. Asked if the understanding between the Sena and the BJP for 21 May Maharashtra Legislative Council elections was an indication that the bickering allies may join hands in the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, Raut replied in the negative. The BJP and the Sena have agreed to contest three seats each in the elections to six local authorities constituencies in the upper house of the Maharashtra legislature. ""This arrangement is due to the sentiments of the local leadership of both the parties. Also, we are fielding candidates in three seats where the Sena has a strong presence,"" Raut said. ""This doesn't, in any way, mean we will have an alliance in 2019. The party is firm on the decision taken by Sena president Uddhav Thackeray that we will fight (future) elections on our own,"" Raut asserted. ""The Sena will win a majority in 2019 and the next chief minister will be of our party,"" he added. Raut, who is the executive editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece  , also claimed the BJP had not won a single election in the North East on its own. It formed governments in the region through the politics of ""jod-tod"", he said. ""Take the case of Meghalaya or Arunachal Pradesh. The BJP would not have formed governments there had it not allied with local parties. So, it was on the strength of other parties that it came to power. The BJP would not have won in Tripura had there been an alliance between the Congress and the TMC,"" the Sena MP said.",PTI,PTI

"Janata Dal (United) president Nitish Kumar on Tuesday, 16 October, appointed Prashant Kishor as the party's vice president, effectively making him the second most powerful person in the party. Kishor, who has worked for a number of parties as a poll strategist, joined the ruling party in Bihar a month ago on 16 September. He is seen to be close to Kumar, the state's chief minister. Party spokesperson KC Tyagi said Kishor's appointment will help it reach out to social segments out of its traditional support base. Kishor took his oath administered by party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Patna in October. Tweeting ahead of the ceremony, Kishor had said, Referring to Kishor’s joining, JD(U) leader, RCP Singh told ANI: “If someone is a poll strategist, he understands polls very well. He is not new. We are happy that he joined us. There is a difference between other parties and us. If you want to work in JD(U), then sky is the limit. He will strengthen our working.” According to several media reports, Kishor has a few tasks up his sleeve, once he makes his foray into politics with the JD(U). reports that one of the first tasks he will most likely handle will be to broker peace between the JD(U) and the BJP. Kishor was both Kumar and Modi’s campaign manager in the 2015 Bihar assembly election and the 2014 Lok Sabha election respectively, helping both parties clinch victories. The article also notes that should the JD(U) decide to jump on to the RJD bandwagon, Kishor’s amicable relations with Lalu Yadav and family will be beneficial. Apart from helping both BJP and JD(U), Kishor also assisted Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh secure a victory against the AAP, by shaping his election campaign as well. However, his association with the Congress did not last long, and the party lost the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand elections, despite him overseeing the campaign. While there were speculations over Kishor’s foray into politics, he recently ruled out the Congress as an option when at an event in Hyderabad he reportedly said: “Rahul (Gandhi) and I are not on the same page. He has his own ideas.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint,The Quint

"Suspended Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar said that the two nation theory was first proposed by Hindu Mahasabha founder VD Savarkar. Speaking at an event in Lahore on Monday, 7 May, Aiyar said that Savarkar “invented” Hindutva and divided people on religious lines. His statement comes in the backdrop of a row over Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s portrait at the Aligarh Muslim University. According to ANI, the leader said: Earlier on 5 May, BJP President Amit Shah had taken to Twitter and spoke of Aiyar’s “admiration” for Tipu Sultan and Jinnah. Responding to BJP slamming him, Aiyar said: The Congress had then rejected the BJP's charge, voiced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi among others, and accused it of deliberately bringing Pakistan into the election discourse to polarise voters. The former Congress leader was at the centre of a major controversy during the Gujarat Assembly election in 2017 when he reportedly invited Pakistani officials to dinner at his New Delhi residence. “He (Modi) is a ‘ ’ (a vile man) who has no ‘ ’ (civility),” said Aiyar, who has often courted controversy with his off-the-cuff remarks.

"“Marriage does not mean that the woman is all time ready, willing and consenting (for establishing physical relations). The man will have to prove that she was a consenting party,” a Delhi High Court bench observed on 17 July. Hearings will continue on a day-to-day basis from 8 August. The bench, comprising C Hari Shankar and Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal, observed that in a marriage, both the man and the woman have a right to say “no” to a physical relationship, PTI reported. In response to NGO Men Welfare Trust,  quoted the bench as saying: “A rape is a rape. Is it that if you are married, it is okay but if you are not, then it’s a rape? Why, then, should there be an exception under 375 of the IPC ? Force is not a precondition for rape,” the   quoted the SC as saying. “If a man puts his wife under financial constraint and says he will not give her money for household and kids expenses, unless she indulges in sex with him and she has to do it under this threat. Later, she filed a rape case against the husband, what will happen?” PTI quoted the bench as saying. It did not agree with the submission of NGO Men Welfare Trust, which is opposing the plea to make marital rape an offence, that in spousal sexual violence, the use of force or threat of force are important elements to constitute the offence. “It is incorrect to say that (physical) force is necessary for rape. It is not necessary to look for injuries in a rape. Today, the definition of rape is completely different,” the court said. The NGO’s representatives Amit Lakhani and Ritwik Bisaria argued that a wife already has protection from sexual violence in a marriage under the available laws, including Prevention of Women from Domestic Violence Act, harassment to married woman, sexual intercourse with wife without her consent while she is living separately and unnatural sex. To this, the court said, if it was already covered under the other laws, why should there be exception in Section 375 of the IPC, which says intercourse or a sexual act by a man with his wife is not rape. Men Welfare Trust was opposing the petitions filed by NGO RIT Foundation and the All India Democratic Women’s Association, which have challenged the constitutionality of Section 375 (which defines rape) of the IPC on the ground that it discriminated against married women being sexually assaulted by their husbands. Earlier, Kolkata-based NGO Hridaya had also opposed the plea to make marital rape an offence, saying consent for physical relations is for all time when a person enters the institution of marriage. The high court had earlier agreed to examine the issue raised in PILs by advocate Karuna Nundy, who represented RIT Foundation and the All India Democratic Women’s Association, and a man and a woman, who have sought striking down the exception in the Indian penal law that does not consider sexual intercourse with a wife, not less than 15 years of age, as rape. The petitions have also sought setting aside of the exception in the rape law that protects husbands, saying that it violates the right to equality, freedom and to live life with dignity provided under the Constitution. The Delhi government had said that quashing the protection husbands enjoy against prosecution for marital rape would lead to “creation of an offence”, which is a legislative job and courts cannot create or legislate an offence, which would be the inevitable outcome of striking down of the exception in the IPC. The Centre has opposed the main petitions saying marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon which may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husbands.

The Facebook data scandal erupted after a whistleblower revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to Trump's 2016 campaign, accessed personal data from 50 million users of the website without their knowledge, and might have kept that data even after the social media giant told the company to delete it. Cambridge Analytica (CA) had created psychological profiles of the 50 million users via a personality prediction app, created by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan. In the post, the US-based firm said it would investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before it changed its platform in 2014 to reduce data access and would conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. Facebook said it was changing the login process in a way that would reduce the data that an app can seek.",PTI,PTI

": Bidar South MLA and businessman Ashok Kheny joined the ruling Congress ahead of the Assembly elections in Karnataka, amidst opposition from within the party. Kheny is the Managing Director of Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprise Limited (NICE), the implementing agency of the Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor (BMIC) project that is facing allegations of irregularities. He joined the party in the presence of Karnataka Pradesh Congress President G Parameshwara and campaign Committee Chief DK Shivakumar, by merging his Karnataka Makkala Paksha with the Congress. Kheny had also met Chief Minister Siddaramaiah before joining the party. Welcoming Kheny, Parameshwara said he was joining Congress without any preconditions, and accepting it's principles. ""His joining Congress will help strengthen the party in Bidar district and thereby ensure the party's victory in all six assembly constituencies there,"" he said. However, several Congress MLAs in Bengaluru and a section within Bidar Congress expressed opposition to Kheny's induction. A group of party workers also staged a protest in Bidar, on Monday. Yeshwantpur MLA ST Somashekar said he is opposed to Kheny's induction, when the House committee report on the alleged irregularities in the BMIC project is still pending before the government for action. ""A few MLAs have also contacted me regarding this. We will inform the chief minister and the KPPC president regarding the allegation against him and about the House Committee report that is pending before the government for action,"" he said. In its report tabled in the Assembly in December 2016,the 11-member committee,headed by Law Minister Jayachandra to look into the alleged violations, concluded that 16 of 22 articles in the framework agreement had been violated by the private partner NICE. It had also recommended an inquiry by CBI, ED, the  vigilance commission or an investigative agency of equal  standing. NICE is the implementing agency of the BMIC project, which includes developing the 111-km four-lane expressway, five townships and supporting infrastructure. However, ruling out any differences within Congress over the issue, Shivakumar said all party leaders, specifically from Bidar district, had been consulted before induction. To a question on NICE, he said ""His business has nothing to do with the politics or the Congress....he may be director at NICE, but NICE has nothing to do with the politics."" Speaking to reporters, Kheny said he has joined Congress for the development of his constituency. Claiming that most Congress leaders are with him and one 
or two may be opposing him because of ""selfish reasons"", he however, did not comment on the House committee report. Meanwhile, opposition BJP and JDS hit out at Congress for inducting Kheny into the party with ""hunger for power."" Former Prime Minister and JDS supremo H D Deve Gowda said Congress was doing everything to win the elections, and raised questions on the future of the House committee  report. BJP leader Suresh Kumar said Congress would have to bear the ""curse"" of the common people and farmers who suffered because of illegalities in the BMIC project.

"Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Thursday launched a scathing attack on the Centre over erstwhile liquor baron Vijay Mallya's claim that he met finance minister Arun Jaitley before leaving India. Surjewala questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on the issue and asked why he is ""afraid to conduct a fair investigation"" in the matter."" ""If the prime minister still does not take action, it will be established that the ' ' (guard/protector) is not a  (participant) but a   (criminal),"" the Congress spokesperson. Surjewala accused Jaitley of not taking action to stop Mallya from leaving the country, saying that he did not alert the CBI, Serious Fraud Investigation Office or the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). The Congress spokesperson referred to party MP PL Punia's claim that he saw Jaitley and Mallya engaged in a conversation in the central hall of Parliament before the latter left the country. He said, ""This contradicts Jaitley's claim that Mallya caught up with him in a corridor."" Surjewala also said that in March 2016, a debate was held in Parliament on the issue, but Jaitley did not speak about having met the former liquor baron. The Congress has held a series of press conferences on this matter after Mallya earlier this week made the   about having met Jaitley before leaving India.

" The Congress has not discussed with other parties the issue of seeking a probe into the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud through a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), its senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, Azad chose to not reply on Army chief Bipin Rawat’s comments on the   (AIUDF) in Assam vis-à-vis the BJP in Assam. However, in the same breathe, he accused the ruling BJP of trying to divert attention from the PNB fraud. “No, we have not had any discussion on this,” Azad said while replying to a query about whether the Congress Working Committee had last week authorised him to speak to other ""like-minded"" parties on pressing for a JPC to probe the fraud, involving billionaire diamond merchant Nirav Modi.

On the   into the matter, the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha added, “We will discuss it when the Parliament Session is there.” Asked about Rawat’s remarks, Azad said he “would not reply” on the remark. “But I would simply say that in the coming days, the BJP will point fingers on so many leaders, parties, to divert the attention from  . They are going to make heaven and hell together to divert the attention of the people,” he added. Seeking to underscore difference between the previous UPA and the current NDA governments, Azad said the Manmohan Singh dispensation had conducted “all sort of enquiries” when the then Opposition, led by the BJP, took up the issue of alleged 2G spectrum scam. “Under this (NDA) government, why every fraudster is going to London and is not coming back? And why all of them have some nexus with top leadership of the present government, directly or indirectly?” Azad asked, apparently referring to liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who is fighting an extradition trial at a court in the British capital. Referring to reports of increase in Muslim population in several districts of Assam, the Army chief had observed that the Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF had grown in the state ""faster"" as compared to the BJP in the 1980s.

" The Congress is taking no chances in Karnataka and has sent in its top guns to avoid a repeat of the Goa and Manipur fiascos in the past, where it failed to form the government despite emerging as the largest party. The party has sent senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ashok Gehlot to the southern state where results of the Assembly polls would be out on Tuesday. The Congress has, however, been 'bitten' thrice, as it failed to retain power in Meghalaya recently, despite emerging as the largest party and the leadership rushing Kamal Nath and Ahmed Patel to the state to build on the advantage. Sources said Azad and Gehlot have reached Bangalore and have met chief minister Siddharamaiah and other party leaders. They are also likely to meet JD-S leaders, including H D Deve Gowda and his son Kumaraswamy, in case it fails to get a majority of its own. The sources say that the Congress is in touch with the JD-S leadership too and have met Kumaraswamy before he left for abroad after the polling ended. Kumaraswamy, who is currently in Singapore, will return on Monday night. The two senior leaders, the sources said, have been sent by the party leadership to ensure that no stone is left unturned for the formation of the next Congress government in Karnataka. AICC general secretary incharge of Karnataka K C Venugopal is also present in the state along with party secretaries incharge of the state. The Congress expressed confidence that the party will get a majority on its own and would repeat its government there. Asked about the party's prospects in Karnataka, Congress communication in-charge Randeep Surjewala said it will get over 130 seats in the state as the people of Karnataka have rejected the politics of corruption and mafia.

They will never say so and this can be stated only by the Congress leader who keeps the party above his own self,"" he said while thanking Siddharamaiah for offering his chair to a Dalit leader. On whether the Congress rules out the possibility of an alignment with the JD(S), Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said, ""It is a hypothetical question that will be rejected at 5 O'clock on Tuesday.""",PTI,PTI
" National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah on Monday reiterated his demand for dissolution of the Jammu and Kashmir legislative Assembly and said the situation in Kashmir is not conducive for polls. His party, however, would take part in the democratic exercise whenever it is held, he added. The National Conference has gone on record to demand the dissolution of the Assembly. ""It is the cure for all the rumours about horse trading, splitting of political parties and government formation,"" Abdullah told reporters. ""We will contest the elections whenever they are held. The reality is that the situation in Jammu may be conducive for polls but the situation in Kashmir is very grave,"" the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister added. The National Conference, Abdullah said, does not demand immediate elections as it understands that it will take time to create a conducive climate. When asked whether the National Conference would move the Supreme Court for dissolution of the Assembly, he said it is something that the party has not yet decided. Speaking about the speculations about the BJP trying to form the government in the state again with rebel PDP MLAs, Abdullah said he would go by senior BJP leader Ram Madhav's tweet wherein he denied the reports. BJP general secretary Ram Madhav on Saturday said his party was for continuing with governor's rule in the state in the interest of peace, governance and development. His comments came after Abdullah tweeted a news report that claimed ""a big chunk of PDP MLAs are in touch with the BJP high command."" Abdullah said the BJP's state unit, however, was telling people otherwise. ""Let us see who is right and who is wrong,"" he said. When asked if the BJP had reached out to him for government formation, the National Conference leader replied in the negative. He asserted his party was not indulging in horse trading and would not have any role in disintegration of the PDP. Abdullah rejected the BJP's claim that the situation in the Valley had improved since the imposition of the governor's rule. ""A few days ago, three civilians were killed in the Kulgam district. I don't see any improvement in the situation. The militant activities too haven't gone down,"" he said. ""May be sitting in Delhi they feel that the situation is improving, but I don't think so sitting here in Kashmir,"" he added. He refused to comment on media speculation about the Islamic State gaining a foothold in Kashmir. The National Conference leader said Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra should work to restore the peace that prevailed in the state during the tenure of his government. ""The atmosphere of brotherhood in the Jammu region, for which my government worked between 2009 and 2014, needs to be restored. There is a world of difference between the prevailing situation and that of 2014,"" Abdullah said. The situation, he added, had only worsened. The National Conference leader blamed the erstwhile PDP-BJP government for the mess in the state. ""Today they are admitting that the government and Mehbooba Mufti as chief minister failed. This is what we were saying for three years. It was an inept government run by inefficient people,"" he said. The former chief minister said allegations of corruption against the ministers of the PDP-BJP government had come to light and his party would take them up with Vohra. ""Many people have reached out to us and levelled allegations of corruption against ministers of the previous government. All these will be taken up with the governor and we hope there will be a fair probe,"" he said. Abdullah asked the National Conference leaders and workers to reach out to the people across the state.

The BJD suspended Panda, the MP from Kendrapara, for alleged anti-party activities on 24 January. The party has also accused Panda of submitting a false affidavit before the Election Commission during the 2014 general elections, a charge denied by the leader. ""Panda has concealed that he is working as an employee of IMFA and drawing crores of rupees as salary.

He also concealed this in the affidavit dated 21 March, 2014 filed as part of his nomination papers for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Agarwal added. Panda has misled the party and the people of his constituency and ""lost moral authority to continue as Member of Parliament from Kendrapara,"" he said.

" Under fire from the Opposition over the Muzaffarpur shelter home rape case, the Janta Dal (United) asserted on Monday that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar would not resign and said it was ready for a Supreme Court-monitored probe into it. Rejecting the demand for Kumar's resignation, senior JD(U) leader KC TYagi slammed opposition leaders including Congress president Rahul Gandhi for attending the RJD-organised protest in Jantar Mantar here yesterday. It was a ""friendship day"" of parties seeking ""political mileage"" from the ""unfortunate and shameful"" incident in the state, he said. ""How can rape of young girls which has shamed us could be an issue for opposition parties to unite against the NDA government and the Nitish Kumar-led government in Bihar and demand his resignation. This politics over hapless victims in Bihar is the most unfortunate thing,"" Tyagi said in a press conference here. Tyagi asserted that despite the Opposition's demand, Kumar would never step down as the chief minister of Bihar and challenged them to unseat him in the Assembly. ""Nitish is a sensitive person and felt ashamed over the incident which the opposition parties are trying to use to hit at his conscience so that he steps down. But, he will never step down, we will not let him do so,"" he said. Tyagi also alleged that the resignation demand was aimed at ""helping"" sand mining and bootlegging that have been effectively checked by the state government. Tyagi criticised Rahul Gandhi, saying his joining the RJD protest at Jantar Mantar was ""unfortunate"". ""I also condemn Sitaram Yechury and D Raja who have forgotten the killings of JNU president Chandra Shekhar and Purnia MLA Ajit Sarkar and joined the protest organised by RJD,"" he said. The JD(U) Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson of the party said that Nitish Kumar had written to the Patna High Court for monitoring the probe into the case and asserted that the party was ready for such a probe by even a Supreme Court-monitored panel. He asserted that the Bihar government acted against the accused swiftly and, as per the wish of RJD and other opposition parties, sought a CBI probe into the incident. ""Still, they are using this incident to spread lies and conspiracy theories for political purpose and to help sand and liquor mafia who have been effectively controlled by the Nitish government in the state,"" he said.

"Tollywood superstar and Jana Sena founder Pawan Kalyan, who recently announced his party's entry into the fray for the 2019 Assembly elections, has time and again criticised the TDP and its leadership. He wants the Centre to probe the alleged corruption charges against the Chandrababu Naidu government in Andhra Pradesh. At a recent rally in Guntur, he said that he regretted extending support to the TDP, which according to him, is topping the list of corruption in the country. The Jana Sena chief had asked Naidu at the rally why was he silent on the special status issue for the last four years, waking up just with elections around the corner, as per this  report. ""Why should anybody support you in 2019? You changed Andhra Pradesh into Corruption Pradesh,"" he had fired. Speaking to  , Kalyan said that 40 TDP MLAs and some party leaders have levelled allegations against Naidu's son Lokesh and other TDP leaders of being involved in corrupt activities. Edited excerpts follow: 
I am not speaking about it all of a sudden. In the last four years, I have raised this point with Naidu, but he doesn't seem serious about looking into the problem. Naidu is fully aware of the corruption taking place in his government. People can look through it and I am not an outsider either. Around 40 MLAs and TDP leaders have complained to me about corruption in the government. They wanted me to explain to the chief minister. I attempted to do so, but he is not serious about looking into it, which is why I am talking about it. The central government should spring into action and look into the irregularities. There is some ulterior motive behind giving the Polavaram project to a private contractor. I know the prime minister very closely, but I have my limitations. I am no parliamentarian. Also, TDP and BJP are not always on good terms. I don't want to get into their business. But now that I have spoken out, TDP leaders are saying that the BJP is the brains behind my statements. Interestingly, some time ago, the YSR Congress chief used to say that Naidu is behind me. But in reality, both are wrong. I am only listening to the public. There is no possibility of a compromise between us and the BJP. People in Andhra Pradesh are very upset with the BJP and they do not trust the party. The demand for special status is not an emotional one but driven by practical needs. There are seven districts in Andhra Pradesh that are like Bundelkhand (in Uttar Pradesh) and are in a very bad condition. To improve the condition of these districts, we need more funds from the central government. It doesn't matter whether the state gets the tag of special status or not. Name or status is not important. The issue is that we need financial help from the central government. Till the time our demands are not met, we will not strike any compromise with the BJP. So far, we are walking alone on this path. At the time of elections, we will decide if we need an alliance or go alone. The Congress and the BJP have not been successful in understanding the regional problems of many states in the country. It is because of this reason that the Third Front is being formed. But regional parties should be able to think about national issues. I have met Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) and told him that about the Third Front, but nothing in detail so far. I would rate Naidu 2.5 and KCR six.",FP Staff,PTI
"Seeking to revive the agitation for OBC quota, Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convener Hardik Patel has appealed the Patidar community to support him to continue the fight.

"The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that newly-appointed Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa must face a floor test in the Assembly on Saturday at 4 pm to ascertain whether or not he has a majority. What this means is as follows: And as the senior-most member of the Assembly, it appears Congress MLA Raghunath Vishvanath Deshpande will be appointed pro tem Speaker. Yeddyurappa took oath as the Chief Minister of Karnataka, thanks to the Supreme Court nod despite a Congress petition against the BJP forming a government in state. But the battle is not over yet, as the BJP still has to prove it has the numbers on the floor of the House. Quoting sources in the Assembly Secretariat,   reported that Deshpande's name has been forwarded to Governor Vajubhai Vala for consideration.  As per convention, the senior-most member of the House is chosen as a pro tem Speaker. His/her main role is that of administering the oath of office and secrecy to the newly-elected MLAs. For the recommendation, it is also taken into account that he or she is not likely to be a candidate for the post of Speaker or a minister. Apart from conducting the proceedings, the pro tem Speaker will take a call on whether the trust vote should be held through a voice vote or ballot. At 71, the eight-time MLA is the senior-most in the House. The current strength of the Assembly is 222 and the magic number is 112.

""Yeddyurappa will turn out one-day chief minister… His fate as the chief minister is dependent on the court hearing,"" Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters in New Delhi. The party also challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah to prove the numbers by Friday. The Congress also attacked Vala, accusing him of encountering Constitution twice, first by inviting the BJP to form government on Thursday and allowing Yeddyurappa to take oath while a matter in this connection is set to be heard on Friday by the Supreme Court. The Congress and the JD(S) had on Thursday night jointly petitioned before the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the oath-taking ceremony, as communicated by the governor to the BJP's chief ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa. The court did not stay the swearing-in ceremony and the next hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday at 10.30 am. In view of the developments, the Congress has decided to protest the on Friday by holding dharnas across the country. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said Yeddyurappa's fate is sealed in his letter given to Vala as it makes no mention of a number bigger than the 104 MLAs of the BJP.   The Union former finance and home minister also said had he been in Yeddyurappa's place, he would not have taken the oath till the apex court took a decision on the petition filed by the Congress-JD(S) combine challenging the governor's decision to invite him to take oath.

" Asserting that stalling the BJP's bid for power in Karnataka has galvanised the Opposition, senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot has said his party will have to be the ""pivot"" of any rainbow coalition formed to take on the BJP in 2019 polls. As the political battleground shifts to the Hindi heartland after an intense power struggle in Karnataka that ended with the Congress-JD(S) government being formed, the former Union minister exuded confidence that the Congress would win the Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh Assembly polls slated for later this year. In an interview to  , Pilot said the anti-BJP forces were now aligning themselves to make sure that the BJP does not come to power in 2019 and the Congress would have a pivotal role to play in that. ""I think it is very clear that at a pan-India level, it is only the Congress party that has the capacity to defeat the BJP. Of course, there are regional parties and alliances that might be forged. But the pivot of any rainbow coalition will have to be the Congress,"" the 40-year-old leader said. With arms aloft on a dais at the swearing-in ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy as chief minister in Bengaluru, a host of opposition leaders had last week sent out a signal that a front to take on the BJP could take shape, setting aside political differences. Kumaraswamy had taken oath at a grand ceremony where a galaxy of top Opposition leaders of national and regional parties, including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP supremo Mayawati and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, were in attendance. Asked if Karnataka's political events leading up to the formation of the Congress-JD(S) government had galvanised the opposition, Pilot answered in the affirmative. However, he asserted that only the Congress has the capacity and the bandwidth to take on the BJP at a pan-India level. There will have to be some sort of understanding in different states, but it is too early to pinpoint what will it be, he said. Asked if plans to project Rahul Gandhi as the leader of a rainbow coalition had taken a hit with the Congress coming second best in Karnataka, Pilot said, ""I don't think anyone wants to project anything. ""Right now, we want to work for the people of India who have been let down by the BJP and the only person in the opposition who I believe is taking on Mr (Narendra) Modi and Mr Amit Shah head on and making them accountable by asking very pertinent questions is Rahul Gandhi."" ""He (Rahul Gandhi) is leading from the front...the Congress party has never projected anything or anyone, but yes he is our party president and if you ask me who should lead, it has to be Mr Gandhi because at an all India level, it is only the Congress party that can actually surmount a formidable challenge to the BJP,"" Pilot said. He asserted that like-minded Opposition parties were already working together and would get more galvanised as the polls near. ""It is too early to say what shape it (the coalition) will or will not take. But yes the intent and the presence of all the leaders in Bangalore was an indication of that formation. It is already work in progress. Mrs (Sonia) Gandhi called a meeting which 17 parties had attended in New Delhi,"" he said. Pilot, who is also the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee chief and is largely seen as the Congress's chief ministerial face in the state, said he was confident that his party would score a ""historic"" victory to unseat the Vasundhara Raje government. Talking about the upcoming Assembly polls in the Hindi heartland later this year, he said the Congress would score victories in the three states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh as there was ""huge anti-incumbency"" against the incumbent BJP governments there. Asked if a win in the three states would change the dynamics for 2019, Pilot said, ""Of course, these three states will be an example of how Congress will win and can win."" The BJP is on its way out and its decline will be ""steep and sharp"", the senior Congress leader said. Pilot also dismissed suggestions that a campaign blitz by Prime Minister Modi, like the one in Karnataka, could impact the voters in Rajasthan. ""There is a limit to what a so-called blitz can do. Here (in Karnataka) we had a Congress government and all Mr Modi did was come and criticise. In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, how will he justify the killing of farmers by the government, how will he justify more than 100 farmer suicides,"" he said. Pilot said it was one thing to campaign against an incumbent government, but defending a government with ""absolute zero performance"" might be a different ball game.",PTI,PTI

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a massive Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rally at the Palace Grounds in Bengaluru on Sunday, 4 February, to mark the conclusion of the party's 90-day Nava Nirman Parivarthan yatra across poll-bound Karnataka. Prime Minister Modi began his address by taking a jibe at Congress, saying that the crowd’s enthusiasm indicated a countdown to the Congress’ exit from Karnataka. “We’ll make Karnataka Congress-free, we will drive the Congress culture away from the state,” he said addressing the rally. Assuring the people that the BJP is not far away from taking over the state, Modi said that the party will speed up development and take Karnataka to new heights. He said that Bengaluru will have 160km of suburban railway network worth 17 ,000 crore rupees, with the complete network spanning 28 stations, in a bid to aid 15 lakh commuters. The move is aimed at solving the traffic problem in Bengaluru. Further, the prime minister laid out his road plans, saying that the BJP has set a goal to build more than 9,000 km-long National Highway this year. Under the Bharatmala Pariyojana, 35,000 km of roads will be constructed, he said.

"Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam founder TTV Dhinakaran said that the “longevity of the anti-people government has been extended” because of Thursday’s judgment. Speaking to reporters, Dhinakaran, who was accompanied by the disqualified MLAs, said, “While one judge has deemed the Speaker’s decision (to disqualify MLAs) as invalid, the CJI has ruled the Speaker’s actions to be valid. But a couple of months ago, the CJI ruled in the Puducherry Speaker’s case that his action wasn’t valid. As a layman, I don’t understand how there can be one law for TN’s Speaker and one for Puducherry’s Speaker.” He said that while he would call for a floor test, the 18 MLAs who are his supporters “are still a part of the AIADMK and only want a change of Chief Minister.” (Source:  ) Pointing out the observation by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on the action taken to close down Sterlite Copper in Thoothukudi following the police firing that claimed 13 lives, Leader of Opposition MK Stalin on Thursday, 14 June, demanded the government to take necessary steps, including a Cabinet resolution to close the polluting unit permanently.

The answer can be found in the two judgements itself. The Chief Justice has in both judgements held that the Speaker’s decisions are subject to judicial review. However, when it comes to reviewing an order passed by the Speaker under the Tenth Schedule (popularly known as the anti-defection law) of the Constitution as was the case in the 18 MLAs case, the scope of judicial review was limited.

": Former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar is likely to contest the Lok Sabha 2019 election from Begusarai constituency in Bihar as a CPM candidate. He is likely to have the support of grand alliance partners RJD, Congress, NCP and Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM(S). ""If the party (CPM) decides to nominate me as its candidate from Begusarai and other grand alliance partners also extend their support, then I don't have any objection to it,"" Kumar told  . He, however, said no formal talks have taken place either at party or alliance partners' level with regard to sharing of seats. A resident of Barauni block in Begusarai district, Kumar's mother is an anganwadi worker and his father is a farmer. Asked if he will still contest the election if CPM decides to go alone in 2019 general elections, Kumar said, ""Alliance is a certainty and party will not go it alone in elections. CPM's party congress has passed a resolution under which it would work and coordinate in forming a grand alliance of which CPM will certainly be a part,"" he said. Sources said Kumar, 31, will be CPM nominee from Begusarai and all other partners of grand alliance such as RJD, Congress, NCP, HAM(S) and Left parties would extend support to him. CPM officials said RJD chief Lalu Prasad has given his consent in this regard. ""Left parties, including the CPM want him to contest the Lok Sabha election from Begusarai in 2019 and other parties such as Congress and RJD also want him to contest the election,"" CPM state secretary Satya Narayan Singh said. Stating that Prasad has given his consent for leaving a seat for Kumar, Singh said, ""During our talks held on earlier occasions, Prasad had agreed to leave a seat for him."" Singh also said his party has decided to contest six Lok Sabha seats in Bihar but a final decision would be taken after talks over seat-sharing with all like-minded parties. The six seats on which the party intends to field its candidates are Begusarai, Madhubani, Motihari, Khagaria, Gaya and Banka. The CPM leader said Kumar has agreed to contest election from Begusarai. Begusarai, once considered a Left bastion, is currently represented by senior BJP leader Bhola Singh, who defeated RJD's Tanveer Hassan in Lok Sabha 2014 elections. CPM candidate Rajendra Prasad Singh, who was also CPM state secretary then, contested from Begusarai in 2014 in alliance with JD(U) and secured third position. An RJD leader, preferring anonymity, said there is a broad consensus among grand alliance partners and Left parties that there should be a joint candidate to defeat BJP and its allies in 2019 polls, but discussions have not started on seat sharing so far.

On Saturday, the petrol price in the national capital breached the Rs 80/litre mark. In Mumbai too, the petrol price rose by 12 paise to reach Rs 87.89 per litre on Sunday, while the diesel price was at Rs 77.09 per litre. The surge in fuel prices is largely attributed to the rise in crude oil prices and high excise duty in the country. Except for relief on Wednesday, 5 September, petrol and diesel rates have gone up every day since 26 August in Delhi, the  . Calling the steep rise in diesel and petrol prices as ‘fuel loot’, the Congress on Thursday called for a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on 10 September, saying it was in touch with other parties for their support, IANS reported. The party once again raised a demand for petrol and diesel to be brought under Goods and Services Tax (GST). The government had earlier rejected the demand, saying most states were opposed to it. At a press conference in Delhi on 6 September, Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said: On Saturday, the Shiv Sena put up posters in Mumbai to protest against the fuel price hike. On Friday, the DMK announced it would extend its support to the Congress party's nationwide shutdown, adding that it would play an active part in making it a success.

The Trinamool Congress on Friday said it supported the issues raised by political parties that had called for a nationwide shutdown on 10 September. However, it added that it will hold protest rallies in West Bengal instead of strikes since these lead to a waste of working hours, IANS reported. DMK chief MK Stalin urged all sections of people, including government employees, teachers, traders and state transport corporation workers, to voluntarily support the bandh to “teach the BJP government a fitting lesson.” It was a matter of concern and anguish that fuel prices were rising fast to touch the Rs 100 per litre mark, he said in a statement, adding that even when crude prices fell, the Centre had not passed on the benefit to the people. Stalin accused oil marketing companies of putting the hike in fuel prices on hold only during elections in states favourable to the BJP, and increasing it after the conclusion of polls. He said the government has ""pushed the people to the streets"" to protest against the price rise. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

": Congress president Rahul Gandhi should be the natural leader of any rainbow coalition of opposition parties if they want to put up a serious challenge to Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) in the 2019 general election, Congress veteran Sheila Dikshit has said. The three-time Delhi Chief Minister said the country was facing serious challenge of ""remaining together"" under the Modi government and all the opposition parties must join hands, leaving aside their differences, to dethrone the current dispensation from power. ""Look he is leading the party. Automatically the one who leads the party is chosen for everything. He is the leader of our party and if Congress has to lead the opposition alliance, then Rahul Gandhi automatically becomes its leader,"" the 80-year-old Congress leader said. Buoyed by results of Karnataka Assembly election as well as recent bypolls, the Congress and and other prominent opposition leaders have been talking about the need to form a grand alliance to stop BJP's electoral juggernaut in 2019 polls but there has been no consensus yet on who will lead such an alliance. ""There is a small movement to bring together all the non-BJP parties is going on. That will require some understandings, some sort of adjustments,"" she told   in an interview. Asked whether the Congress should try to stitch together the coalition, Dikshit said the time has come for such an alliance the party should go for it. The Congress leader, who was the chief minister of Delhi between 1998 and 2013, said India was going through a ""very difficult phase"" and that opposition parities must leave aside their differences for the sake of the country's future. ""As a country, the biggest struggle for us is to remain together. We are a nation which has got every religion. Some may be bigger, some may be smaller. The basic philosophy of the country is to carry everybody together and make everybody feel that he is an Indian first. The Congress gave the feeling to everybody,"" she said.

Asked about Sonia Gandhi's role in the party, Dikshit said she remains the guiding force of the party and will remain so. ""Sonia Gandhi has been the leader of the party for over two decades.

" The Centre today opposed a PIL in the Supreme Court for barring candidates from contesting more than one constituency in a general election, saying that the issue of electoral reforms would need legislative action and that the plea failed to establish that fundamental rights of citizens were being infringed upon in any way. In an affidavit, the central government said that the writ petition maybe dismissed as it has failed to show “any infringement” of any fundamental or constitutional rights of the people at large. “It is prayed that amending section 33 (7) of the Representative of Peoples Act may cause the infringement of the rights of the candidates contesting elections as well as curtails choice of candidates to the polity,” said the affidavit filed by K.K. Saxena, deputy secretary with the Ministry of Law and Justice. The affidavit would be considered by a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra. The petition was filed by BJP leader Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay. The affidavit said that a person has been allowed under the Act to contest election from two constituencies simultaneously and the law has to be amended for disallowing the same. “It is humbly submitted that the answering respondent is conscious of the need for electoral reforms in our country; however, electoral reforms is a complex, continuous, long-drawn and comprehensive process…,” it said, adding that relevant laws would be made from time to time. The objective of curtailing the right of a candidate to stand for election from two seats would require a legislative amendment, said the affidavit and sought dismissal of the PIL. The Election Commission of India, in its affidavit in December last year, had quoted its 2004 proposals on electoral reforms and said that the law should be amended to ensure that a person cannot contest more than one seat. The poll panel had also said that its proposal to bar candidates from contesting more than one seat was rejected by a parliamentary standing committee way back in 1998, which had taken note of the view of an all-party meeting favouring to retain the provision. Upadhyay has also sought directions to the authorities to take appropriate steps to discourage independent candidates from contesting parliamentary and state assembly elections as suggested by the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC). He said the question of independent candidates is often connected with the issue of fragmented voting and instability in the electoral system and referred to the law commission’s 170th report, which said “the time is now ripe for debarring independent candidates from contesting Lok Sabha elections”. “Similarly, the NCRWC has recommended discouragement of independent candidates, who are often dummy candidates or defectors from their party or those denied party tickets,” said the petition.",PTI,PTI

"Days after the Supreme Court said the controversy over the death of Special CBI Court Judge BH Loya is ""serious"",   on Friday, 26 January, published an investigative report that raised a multitude of questions over the documents submitted by the Maharashtra government to the apex court as part of the court hearings on the matter. A three-judge Supreme Court bench – led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra – is currently hearing two PILs seeking an independent probe into Judge Loya’s death. Based on the analysis of documents submitted to the SC and a report by the Maharashtra State Intelligence Department (SID), as well as its own investigations over the course of time,  's story concludes thus: Judge Loya, who was hearing the sensitive Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter, in which BJP President Amit Shah was an accused, had allegedly died of cardiac arrest in Nagpur on 1 December 2014, when he had gone to attend the wedding of a colleague's daughter. The issue of Loya's death has been in the spotlight since November 2017, when  had published a report raising suspicions over the circumstances leading to his death. According to  report, the documents submitted to the court include a significant statement from Judge Roopesh Rathi – who was purportedly with Loya before his death, along with three other judges. Rathi, in his statement, points out that when Loya was taken to the Dande Hospital in Nagpur after complaining of severe chest pain, the ECG machine there was not working. This statement of Rathi's – the report points out – comes in contradiction to some news reports citing an ECG chart to indicate that an ECG was indeed carried out on Loya at the Dande Hospital. Raising doubts over the authenticity of the ECG chart, the report says: The magazine also claims that the documents submitted to the apex court exclude various vital records which might have been doctored or manipulated. The report raises questions not just with regard to the Dande Hospital, but also the Meditrina Hospital in Nagpur, where Judge Loya was taken subsequently. It states that the medico-legal consultant at Meditrina, Ninad Gawande, has made contradictory statements with regard to the purported ECG chart from the Dande Hospital. The writer notes the contradiction in Gawande's conduct as follows: Not just this, the report also points out to a ""Final Impatient Bill"" for the treatment of Loya at the Meditrina Hospital, which makes mentions of a fee for ""neurosurgery"". Considering that Judge Loya apparently showed signs of a heart attack, the reference to ""neurosurgery"" in the bill raises questions, the report indicates. According to   report, among the documents submitted to the Supreme Court are two accidental death reports prepared by Sitabuldi police station and Sadar police station in Nagpur respectively. It goes on to indicate that while the former mentions the time and death of Judge Loya as 6:15 am, 30 November 2014, the latter says it occurred at 6:15 am on 1 December 2014. In its latest report,   says that many questions regarding the role of individuals named Ishwar Baheti and his brother Hansraj Baheti, both allegedly having connections with the RSS, remain unanswered in the documents. The investigations carried out by the magazine in the whole case indicate that Ishwar Baheti, a resident of Latur, had been in touch with Loya's family regarding his death. Baheti also apparently possessed Loya's mobile phone, returning it to the family several days after his death, ""with call records and messages erased"". According to   report, the documents submitted to the SC include statements from Loya's family members, sister Anuradha Biyani, father Harkishan Loya and son Anuj Loya, which say that the family doesn't have any suspicions regarding the judge's death. The report argues that these statements might have been taken under duress, as it questions the use and the authority of the state intelligence apparatus in the case. Lastly, the report points out that the documents submitted to the SC fail to explain why Judge Loya's name was absent in the occupancy register of Ravi Bhawan guesthouse, where he was apparently staying at the time of his death. The report notes this absence of name as unusual, as it claims that the record-keeping at the Ravi Bhawan has otherwise been quite ""meticulous"". (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" Launching a scathing attack on the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the party is now being called a “bail gaadi” as several of its leaders are out on bail. “Several leaders who are called stalwarts of the Congress and former ministers are out on bail these days,” Modi said at a public rally here, punning on the Hindi term for a bullock cart. He said people were well aware of the “intentions” of the Congress party and had started calling it a “bail gaadi”. Making an apparent reference to the surgical strike into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in 2016, he criticised the Congress for questioning the capabilities of the Army. “It is unfortunate that political opponents also committed a sin by raising questions on the capabilities of the Army. This has never happened before and the people will not forgive those who are doing this kind of politics,” he said. The prime minister said his government had resolved the issue of one rank, one pension for defence personnel.

"The BJP on Tuesday, 8 May announced that Mriganka Singh, the daughter of late MP Hukum Singh, would be its candidate for the Lok Sabha bypoll in Uttar Pradesh's Kairana. The Kairana Lok Sabha seat fell vacant due to the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh in February. The Rashtriya Lok Dal has fielded Tabassum Begam, who is likely to emerge as a joint candidate of the opposition, to take on the BJP in Kairana. Madhav Lal Singh will be the party's candidate from Gomia in Jharkhand, Munni Devi from Tharali in Uttarakhand and Sujit Ghosh from Maheshtala in West Bengal. The names for one Lok Sabha seat and four state assembly seats were finalised in the party central election committee on Tuesday, the BJP said in a statement. The last date for filing of nomination for the two by-elections is 10 May. “My father had developed a bond with this constituency over almost 40 years. It had been a long association for him, and Kairana also happens to be his native place,” Mriganka Singh (57) told PTI in an earlier interview. Her father won seven assembly election before entering Lok Sabha in 2014. Reminded that she had lost from the Kairana assembly seat in the 2017 state polls, she said, ""I did lose the UP Assembly elections because of the polarisation which took place then, and also due to a division of votes."" But she said the Lok Saha constituency covers a much wider area, and the situation is different now. Kairana was the scene of a ""Hindu exodus"", a controversial claim made by Hukum Singh, pointing fingers at the Muslim population in the area. Later, he appeared to backtrack on his own assertion. But the daughter implies it happened. ""However, after the BJP government under Yogi Adityanath was formed, the law and order scenario in the region has improved. It is exemplary. At least five or six families, to my knowledge, have returned to Kairana,"" she said.       (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",PTI,The Quint

" With the filing of nominations for Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council elections coming to a close on Monday, the ruling BJP on Sunday sounded confident of bagging 11 out of 13 seats going to polls on 26 April, even as the saffron party released its list of candidates for the biennial elections. In a statement issued by the party's central office in Delhi, the BJP announced 10 candidates for the state council polls. The BJP candidates include UP ministers Mahendra Singh and Mohsin Raza. The party also named Sarojini Agarwal, Bukkal Nawab, Yashwant Singh, Jaiveer Singh, Vidhyasagar Sonkar, Vijay Bahadur Pathak, Ashok Kataria and Ashok Dhawan as its other candidates. 
Ashok Kataria, Vidyasagar Sonkar and Vijay Bahadur Pathak are general secretaries of the Uttar Pradesh BJP, while Ashok Dhawan hails from Varanasi and is a former MLC. A senior party leader requesting anonymity said that the 11th seat is likely to be used to accommodate Ashish Singh Patel, who is a senior leader of the Apna Dal-(Sonelal). The AD(S) is an ally of the BJP in the state and currently has nine MLAs in the Assembly. The BJP and its allies enjoy a brute strength of 324 out of the 403 seats in the Assembly. Arithmetically, they are likely to win 11 out of 13 seats comfortably and still be left with some additional votes. Though the BJP and its allies have the majority in the Assembly, they may not get the required strength in the Upper House to get Bills passed even after winning 11 of the 13 seats by the dint of their strength. Even if they win the 11 seats, they will be far short of the half-way mark in the council. During the Winter Session of the state legislature last year, the state government had suffered an embarrassment when it failed to ensure the passage of the Uttar Pradesh Control of Organised Crime (UPCOC) Bill in the council. On the council elections, UP BJP vice president J P S Rathore said to ensure victory, a candidate needs 29 first preference votes. The notification for the council polls was issued on 9 April. The last date for filing nominations is 16 April. Scrutiny of nominations will be done on 17 April, while the last date for withdrawal of the candidature is 19 April. ""We are sure of winning 11 out of the 13 seats in the council seats which are going to polls,"" state BJP spokesperson Navin Srivatava told  . For the remaining two seats, the Samajwadi Party has given up one seat for the Bahujan Samaj Party, taking the new-found bonhomie between the two parties a step foward. The SP, headed by Akhilesh Yadav, had fielded two candidates, but withdrew one of them, paving the way for Mayawati's party to contest one seat as a quid pro quo for her support to the SP in the Lok Sabha bypolls to Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats, which halted the saffron party's victory march in the bastion of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath (in Gorakhpur). In 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won the Phulpur parliamentary constituency for the first time. However, in the Rajya Sabha elections, it was a sweet revenge for the BJP, as it ensured victory of all its nine candidates, days after it lost two crucial seats in the Lok 
Sabha bypolls in the state. In the 100-member UP Legislative Council, the BJP has just 13 members. The Samajwadi Party has 61 members, the BSP nine, the Congress two, the RLD one and others 12. Two seats are vacant. 
SP spokesperson and MLC Sunil Singh Sajan said the SP-BSP combine will comfortably win the two council seats. ""The Samajwadi Party is contesting on one seat in the legislative council polls. Initially, we had decided to contest two seats, but later we decided to give one seat to the 
BSP to strengthen our electoral understanding,"" he said. According to the Election Commission, tenures of 13 MLCs, including SP national president Akhilesh Yadav, and two ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government—Mahendra Kumar Singh and Mohsin Raza—will end on 5 May. Of the 13 seats falling vacant, seven were held by the SP, two each by the BJP and the BSP, and one by the RLD. The 13th seat was held by former SP minister Ambika Chaudhary. His seat fell vacant when he switched over from the SP to the BSP. Apart from the SP chief, six other MLCs from the party whose terms are coming to an end are state SP chief Naresh Chandra Uttam, senior party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary, Umar Ali Khan, Madhu Gupta, Ramsakal Gurjar and Vijay Yadav. MLCs from other parties whose terms ends on 5 May are Vijay Pratap and Sunil Kumar Chittor (both BSP) and Chaudhary Mushtaq: the lone RLD member.",PTI,PTI
"Kashmiri journalist Ahmed Ali Fayyaz on Sunday said unidentified people who had run a vilification campaign against     editor Shujaat Bukhari, were now targeting him and journalist Iftikhar Gilani.

The blog’s authors have also targeted other journalists, businessmen, politicians and activists engaged in Track-2 diplomacy, berating them for betraying the “struggle of Kashmir” and for carrying out the “dirty work of defaming [the] Kashmir cause”. “They have posted our photographs on the same portal with a vitriolic heap of text which vilifies and denigrates us both as ‘dubious characters’, men of ‘hypocritical approach’ et al,” Fayyaz wrote in a Facebook post.  Fayyaz wrote that the allegations against him were unfounded. “I have never ever taken upon myself the task of strengthening or weakening any narrative or ideology or attempted to impose my personal ideology on my esteemed readers who are from vast, diverse opinions and backgrounds,” he said. “So it is completely malicious and preposterous to allege that I have anybody’s brief in discharging my duty.” The journalist denied that he had ever taken part in a Track-2 diplomatic initiative. “I have never ever claimed to be the ‘saviour of Kashmiri cause’ or someone ‘finding a solution to the Kashmir problem’, he wrote. “I believe this is not a proscribed activity for a journalist but I have been holding the opinion that this job should be left to other organs of the civil society.” He also refuted the allegation that he had not spoken up against Bharatiya Janata Party leader Choudhary Lal Singh’s   to journalists, and that he influenced American and Indian policies in the region. “Throughout my career I have steered clear of such state and non-state affiliations and diplomatic operations,” the journalist wrote. “My activity has been purely professional and academic while attending only those conferences and workshops which are not directly or indirectly sponsored by any side of the Kashmir conflict.” Fayyaz said he had written against both state and non-state actors and exposed “the atrocities they committed against helpless, voiceless people”. “I neither need a certificate from any masked keyboard actor nor will I ever take dictation under any naked or insidious threat from any individual or country under any circumstances,” he wrote. “Those trying it, for whatever purpose, will be simply wasting their own time and energy.”",Scroll Staff,Scroll Staff

"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday, 16 April launched a sharp attack on the Congress after a court acquitted right-wing activist Swami Aseemanand and four others in the 2007 Mecca Masjid blast case, claiming that the Opposition party's ""appeasement politics"" of ""defaming"" Hindus has been exposed. The anti-terror probe agency National Investigation Agency (NIA) in Hyderabad acquitted the five accused, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove charges against them. A massive blast had ripped through the Mecca Masjid on 18 May 2007, during Friday prayers, killing nine people and wounding 58 others. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that the Congress has long ""defamed"" Hindus for votes – and demanded that party president Rahul Gandhi and his predecessor Sonia Gandhi apologise for terms such as ""saffron terror"" and ""Hindu terror"". Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi, Patra wondered if the Congress President would lead a candle march to India Gate and apologise for his attempts to ""defame"" Hindus. Patra also raked up several comments by Congress leaders and a US diplomatic cable which had allegedly quoted Gandhi as saying that radicalised Hindu groups posed a bigger danger to the country. Former home ministers P Chidambaram, Shivraj Patil and Sushil Kumar Shinde had also spoken about ""saffron terror"" and ""Hindu terror"", Patra alleged. He also claimed that Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was also practising appeasement politics, an euphemism used by the BJP for alleged pro-Muslim politics of some parties. Patra accused Siddaramaiah of ""hobnobbing"" with a Muslim outfit, Popular Front of India, while it is being probed by the National Investigation Agency.

Asking the Congress to clarify its stand on the mater, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Saturday, 3 November that the Ram temple was never a poll issue but a “matter of belief” for the BJP, reported PTI. “This is an issue (concerning) the country,"" asserted Javadekar. With the Winter Session of the Parliament due in December, members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the its ideological parent body RSS are pushing for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. BJP MP Rakesh Sinha on Thursday, 1 November, took to Twitter to hint that he will bring up a private member’s bill for the construction of the temple and asked if the Congress, BSP and other Opposition parties will support it. Sinha also said that the verdict in cases like Section 377 and Sabarimala did not take that long, but the verdict on Ayodhya has been pending for decades. Reacting to Sinha’s tweets, Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that such a move will show the country the Congress’ true face and the BJP doesn’t need certification from National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah whose “loyalties lie with Pakistan.” “Rakesh Sinha is such a leader who knows the cultural arrangements across the country. The people will get to see Congress' face, if it favours the temple or opposes it. Rahul Gandhi still doesn't know if he is a Hindu or a non Hindu. He is going from temple to temple to become a Hindu. Then why is he quiet on Ram temple? We don't need a certificate from somebody like Farooq Abdullah whose loyalties are with Pakistan. he eats here and sings there,” said Singh. The demand for bringing an ordinance for early construction of Ram temple has intensified within the BJP and various Sangh Parivar outfits. RSS spokesperson Arun Kumar said the court should deliver an early verdict and the government should make a law to remove hurdles and give land for the temple if required. ""With this in view, the Supreme Court should make an early decision and if there are any difficulties, the government should make a law to remove all hurdles in the way of giving land for temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site,"" Kumar said. The Sangh affiliate VHP was more blunt, saying Hindus cannot wait eternally for judicial verdict as it pushed for a legislation. Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government has full faith in the court and added that a lot of people in the country want the hearing on the issue to be completed soon. BJP leader Vinay Katiyar alleged the issue was being delayed ""under pressure"" from the Congress. ""The decision is being delayed under pressure from the Congress. People like Kapil Sibal (Congress leader) and Prashant Bhushan (Supreme Court advocate) are pressing for delaying the issue. Till when will Ram bhakts (devotees) wait?

""If they tell me Ram Mandir will be built only over my dead body, then so be it,"" she told India Today. She called for an out-of-court settlement in the matter, asking political parties to take the lead on behalf of the litigants. ""Rahul Gandhi, Mulayam Singh, Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati, the Left parties will have to support us but they aren't letting the matter settle [...] The Congress will have to leave the habit of dividing the country in the name of religion,"" Bharti said. Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and J&K National Conference (NC) Leader Farooq Abdullah slammed Sinha for hinting towards a bill and said that it is the people who will vote for the BJP and not Ram or Allah. “They (BJP) think that Lord Ram will win them the 2019 elections. The God will not help them win the elections, it is the people who will vote, neither Lord Ram nor Allah will vote,” he said. Aparna Yadav, daughter-in-law of Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, said that she trusts the Supreme Court but the temple should be built. Senior Congress Leader P Chidambaram had said on Monday, 29 October, that it was a familiar story every five years before the elections when the BJP tried to polarise the issue.

": Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray Sunday sought to intensify the party's campaign for Ram temple in Ayodhya by giving a new slogan which called for the construction of temple before government. Thackeray held a meeting with senior party leaders to review preparations for his visit to Ayodhya on 24 and 25 November. Sena leaders from outside Maharashtra too attended the meeting. ""Har Hindu ki yahi pukar, pehle mandir fir sarkar (Every Hindu has one demand, the temple first and then government),"" he said at a press conference which was held later. The Shiv Sena, which is the part of the BJP-led governments in both Maharashtra and the Centre, has been aggressively pushing for the construction of the temple since the party's annual Dussehra rally in October.

"The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday said it was working through various channels to find what United States President Donald Trump meant when he said the future of the free trade agreement between the two countries, which was recently renegotiated, would depend on the outcome of his talks with North Korea,   reported. “I may hold it [the trade deal] up until after a deal is made with North Korea,” Trump said in a speech in Ohio on Thursday. “Does everybody understand that? Because it is a very strong card, and I want to make sure everyone is treated fairly, and we are moving along very nicely with North Korea.

"The polls in Mizoram on 28 November will see 209 candidates fight it out for the 40 Vidhan Sabha seats. While the Congress and the Mizo National Front (MNF) have fielded 40 candidates each, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has nominated 39 candidates. Like the previous elections, women voters, once again, outnumber the men in Mizoram. In the electorate of 768,181 voters, 393,685 are women and 374,496 are men. Here's a look at how the people of Mizoram voted in the last two Vidhan Sabha elections: The Congress, which is currently battling anti-incumbency and infighting in Mizoram, has ruled the state for a decade now. In the 2013 election, the Congress won 34 of the 40 seats in the Assembly. The MNF, which had fielded candidates from 31 constituencies, had bagged five seats, and the Mizoram People's Conference (MPC) got one. In the 2008 election, the Congress won 32 seats, while the MNF won only three, the MPC won two , the Zoram Nationalist Party (ZNP) won two, and the Maraland Democratic Front (MDF) bagged one. In the seven elections held since Mizoram was formed, the BJP has never won a single seat. With the   in the 28 November election, one can expect a neck-and-neck contest between the regional party and Congress. If we look at the past two elections, the Congress got hold of the highest number of seats in state Assembly, but the difference in the vote shares between the two was not much. While 2,55,917 voters (44.63 percent of the total) across constituencies voted for the Congress in 2013, the MNF got 1,64,305 votes (28.65 percent) overall. In 2008, the margin was even smaller —  the Congress had captured a total of 1,95,614 (38.89 percent) votes, while the MNF had secured a total of 1,54,132 votes (30.65 percent). Mizoram saw a decent voter turnout in the previous two elections. In 2008, the state recorded a turnout of 82.35 percent, which rose marginally to 83.41 percent in 2013. 
 
While it may be a small state, the election assumes significance in Mizoram since it is the only northeastern state under Congress rule. If the Congress wins once again, Lal Thanhawla is likely to return as the chief minister for a third term and hold the party's fort in the region. In the event of an MNF victory, there is also a likelihood of the BJP getting into a post-poll alliance with the party to be part of the state government.",FP Staff,FP Staff
"Hitting back at the Prime Minister for his ""2+1 formula"" jibe at him, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday, 1 May, said that Narendra Modi's formula to win the assembly election in the state is ""2 Reddys + 1 Yeddy"". Addressing a rally earlier in the day, PM Modi had likened Siddarammaiah contesting from two seats, and his son Yatindra contesting the polls as the ‘Kannada version’ of Congress' family politics. Responding to Modi’s jibe, Siddaramaiah in retaliation tweeted: 'Yeddy' is a reference to BJP's chief ministerial candidate B S Yeddyurappa. Siddaramaiah further pointed out that the PM had contested from two seats during 2014 Lok Sabha elections. On Monday, 30 April, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah posed a few questions to PM Modi, even as the BJP’s star-campaigner arrived in Karnataka. Ahead of the PM’s rally in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah took to Twitter to ask Modi to “address the following concerns”. In his next tweet, Siddaramaiah asked Modi to clarify the air around G Janardhan Reddy’s supposed campaign trail in support of B Sriramulu, the party candidate from Badami. Reddy, a scam-tainted mining baron, has not been included in the electioneering list, but will be campaigning for his “friend” Sirarmulu. Speaking to reporters earlier, BS Yeddyurappa, the CM candidate from BJP had said: “Janardhan Reddy has not been included in the electioneering list of the BJP. He is campaigning not for the party, but for his friend Sriramulu.” Siddaramaiah then asked the prime minister if Yeddyurappa is still his party’s chief ministerial candidate, when he reportedly is unwilling to share a stage with the latter. According to a report by  , Yeddyurppa will be present at only one of the many rallies to be held by PM Modi on 1 May. Hitting out at the series of advertisements that the BJP had taken out in newspapers promising action against rape accused in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah tweeted: In UP’s Unnao rape case, BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is an accused. Meanwhile in Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir, where an eight-year-old was raped and murdered, BJP leaders have been demanding a CBI probe, which is seen by many as a move to ‘shield the accused.’ Siddaramaiah, in his next tweet, criticised the shock demonetisation of November 2016, which left several people across the country in a limbo owing to cash-crunch. He also hit out at the prime minister for his ‘pakoda’ comment. Siddarmaiah ended his tweet storm with one final question, criticising the NDA’s government’s farm relief package and the banking mess in the economy. PM Modi is scheduled to begin his campaign blitzkreig in Karnataka starting 1 May, and is expected to address over a dozen rallies in five days. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

This is, of course, not the first time that politicians in India have resorted to crowd-funding to finance their campaigns. In 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party had started a crowd-funding   called “Donate To AAP” which managed to collect over 10 lakh rupees in its first week.

Mevani won the seat by a margin of over 20,000 votes. In fact, the Congress party itself in the recently concluded crowd-funded its campaign for a candidate from Molakalmuru candidate to take down the Reddy brothers’ close confidante Sriramulu.

" Former TRS leader and Chevella MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy Sunday hinted at the possibility of a ""tacit understanding"" between the ruling party in Telangana and the BJP behind Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao's move to dissolve the Vidhan Sabha before completion of its full term. The dissolution of the Assembly in September this year had paved the way for early polls in the southern state. The elections to the 119-member Assembly are scheduled on 7 December. Reddy, who recently crossed over to the Congress, said the decision to hold early elections came as a ""shock"" to the people. Addressing reporters, he claimed that factors like the chief minister's ""tacit understanding with the Bhartiya Janata Party"" or ""falling popularity of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti"" might be behind the chief minister's move to dissolve the House. ""It was a matter of shock for all the people as to why the TRS government didn't complete the five years mandate given to them. Why would any government voluntarily dissolve the House and take the risk of being put under President's rule by the Central government?"" ""There was either a tacit understanding with the BJP or this step was taken out of fear due to the fast declining graph of the TRS in the state,"" he said. Reddy, who had won Chevella seat as a TRS candidate, joined the Congress on 23 November in the presence of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in a public meeting at Medchal. The chief minister had already dismissed reports that his move to dissolve the House was motivated politically. His daughter and Nizamabad MP MP K Kavitha has denied that her party had a ""covert"" understanding with the BJP. She has accused the Congress of spreading such rumours to get minority votes. Meanwhile, referring to his previous stint in the TRS, Reddy said some of his initiatives were appreciated by the national and international bodies such as Unicef, but were not recognised by the KCR- led party. ""I was constantly insulted by various means including removal of my flex boards in the constituency (Chevella),"" he said. Reddy said the state government is yet to formally apply to the Centre seeking a national status for the Kaleshwaram project though it has been raising the demand. The chief minister had laid the foundation stone for the Kaleshwaram irrigation project, taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 80,500 crore, on May 2, 2016. The project aims to take water to the state's drought-hit regions. Reddy further said the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, which ensures that no state government goes about spending its budget indiscriminately, has been completely neglected by the state. ""The state government debt is to the tune of Rs 2.20 lakh crore. It works out at around Rs 61,000 per person if apportioned to individual citizens in the state,"" he said. Responding to a query, Reddy said the TRS took an ambiguous stand on the Triple Talaq Bill that was passed by Parliament recently. The Congress had last month forged 'Prajakutami' (People's Alliance) with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of Chandrababu Naidu, the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) to take on the TRS in upcoming polls.",Press Trust of India,Press Trust of India

"As the state of Rajasthan gears up for Assembly polls scheduled to be held on 7 December, BJP leader and Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has dismissed that there’s any anti-incumbency on the field, expressing confidence that they are going to win the election. In an interview to Times Now, Raje attacked the Opposition while saying that the BJP has a democratic system, wherein “leaders rise from the grassroots”. Questioning what work has the Opposition Congress done for the farmers in the last 50 years, she said that her government has gone ahead with soil cards and connection of markets, among other things. Raje also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that she couldn’t have done the work that she did had she been alone.

"Former Congress leader Arif Mohammad Khan blamed the Grand Old Party for the stalemate over the triple talaq bill in Rajya Sabha, alleging that it had acted on the directions of the AIMPLB in the Upper House. Khan, a staunch supporter of reforms in the Muslim personal laws, had resigned from the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in 1986 due to his differences over the Muslim personal law bill piloted by the dispensation to nullify the verdict in the Shah Bano case. ""You are exercising your power (as members of Rajya Sabha) to meet the whims of one organisation. You could have said your views (of AIMPLB) would be considered sympathetically. This raises serious questions, including about the dignity of the House,"" he claimed. He blamed the Congress for stalling the triple talaq bill in the Upper House. Defending the provision for a three-year imprisonment in the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017, Khan said, ""Only through an effective deterrent punishment can the criminal act of instant divorce be checked."" Khan told   in an interview that instant divorce was a criminal act under Islamic jurisprudence and it deserved an effective, deterrent punishment. ""They (Congress) made a law in 1986 to negate the Supreme Court's judgement in favour of Muslim women in the Shah Bano case and they now stopped a law being made in pursuance of the judgement of the apex court. It is a clear case of political expediency,"" he alleged. The Supreme Court in the Shah Bano case had upheld the right to alimony. Its judgement had triggered a controversy about the extent to which courts can interfere in Muslim personal law. 
Khan claimed that there was growing support among Muslim men as well for the bill. Speaking on the Opposition's demands over subsistence allowance for Muslim woman, he said the bill was for a limited purpose of enforcing the Supreme Court's judgement. The government has to enforce all laws, including those emanating from the Supreme Court, he added. Khan claimed that when the Congress did not refer the Shah Bano bill to any committee, how could they now demand that the triple talaq bill be referred to a select committee.

BJP chief Amit Shah has said that the party is important and not the person. That does not work in Karnataka though"".

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is repeating his speech at every place, mentioning about Yeddyurappa's jail stint and the Saubhagya welfare schemes, but the BJP's CM candidate is not giving a befitting reply to him, he says. ""Probably his health is not permitting him to campaign the way he used to do earlier. Otherwise, there is no reason for him to be silent,"" he adds. When asked about the ""fading glory"" of 75-year-old Yeddyurappa, Gurumurthy, caretaker of Shikaripura constituency, says, ""He has not been sidelined at all. These are fake reports. He is in his 'full form', else he would not have undertaken the padayatra for 85 days, covering all 224 constituencies just before the election campaign. ""We got 20 days to campaign after the filing of nominations. Since he is the state party president, he had to be a part of the candidate selection process. Therefore, he could not campaign during the first one week,"" Gurumurthy, who is also the district BJP general secretary, says. ""Now that the election campaign has started, Yeddyurappa is touring four constituencies on a daily basis,"" he says. ""Also, the central party chief has told mass leaders to campaign separately in the state as less time is left to cover the major constituencies,"" he says. The BJP leader also addressed the reports of Yeddyurappa not sharing stage with the prime minister or party chief Amit Shah. ""Yeddyurappa sharing stage with the prime minister or Amit Shah is not important, winning the election is important for us,"" Gurumurthy says. Yeddyurappa has not visited his constituency in last five years, still the party workers are working hard to ensure that the Lingayat leader wins with 50,000 votes margin in the upcoming state polls, he adds.

Currently going on in Vijayawada, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president's fast is an attempt to pressurise the Central government to fulfill all commitments made at the time of bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014. Naidu, who turned 68 on Friday will fast till 7 pm, reports said. Addressing the Telugu Desam Party coordination committee meeting in Vijayawada on Monday, Naidu had asked 13 ministers to lead the protest in each district. The remaining nine ministers will be joining the chief minister in Vijayawada. ""All MLAs and in-charges of 175 Assembly segments should organise mass hunger-strike in their respective constituencies in solidarity with my fast,"" the TDP chief had said. He had also directed party leaders to organise bicycle rallies in all constituencies from 21 April to highlight his government's ""victories"". Public meetings should be held in all constituency headquarters, he had said.

Naidu made his announcement to fast on 14 April. It came close on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's day-long hunger strike on 12 April to protest the disruption of the Parliament. ""Is it not the Central government which is responsible for the Parliament not functioning smoothly?"" Naidu had asked. The second half of the Budget Session of the Parliament was washed out due to protests by various parties including the TDP, which sought to move a no-confidence motion against the government after pulling out of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Naidu's decision to sit on fast came amid ongoing protests by various political parties in the state against the Centre for not fulfilling its promises. At a meeting in Guntur district on 14 April, Naidu said there would be no compromise on the state's rights. He also announced that a massive public meeting would be organized at Tirupati on 30 April with the slogan ""save the state from betrayal and conspiracy"", recalling that it was in the same temple that four years ago, Modi, as the prime ministerial candidate, had promised special status but did not fulfill it after coming to power. Lashing out both at BJP and the opposition parties YSR Congress and Congress, Naidu also appealed to the people to ensure the victory of TDP in all 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2019. He recalled that the TDP played a key role in government formation at the Centre in the past. ""We played a key role in the National Front, United Front and the NDA-I,"" he said.

"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pulling out of its partnership with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Jammu and Kashmir is just the latest example of the troubles within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). From Jammu and Kashmir to Maharashtra, and from Andhra Pradesh to Bihar, the saffron party has had multiple showdowns with its many political allies.

To try and strengthen the party's position ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Shah met Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai on 6 June purportedly to mollify the latter and convince him to support the BJP in the future. The Sena has been one of the BJP's oldest allies, but the two have clashed repeatedly over the past few years and have been   The latest flashpoint occurred in May over the   project, a 15,000-acre undertaking planned in Nanar village of Ratnagiri district in coastal Konkan region, around 350 kilometres from Mumbai. A miffed Shiv Sena repeatedly hit out at the BJP for what it called a high-handed attitude of the NDA towards its smaller allies. The relationship had deteriorated to the point where the Sena described   in a recent editorial in party mouthpiece  . ""Though the state government is running on Sena's support, it is living a post-divorce life. The Maharashtra government is one of the best examples of how to be together, clearly under coercion, and maintain the 'alliance' even when there is no correspondence with each other,"" it said. Party leader Sanjay Raut, who pens the editorials, likened the project to the Ram Temple being destroyed in Ayodhya and a temple of Ravana being erected in its place. Raut also accused Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis of reneging on his promise that the Nanar project would not continue if locals were opposed to it. ""Gujaratis and Marwaris are buying up land in and around Nanar,"" he said, adding, ""The dust of confusion is everywhere in the state. The government has lost itself in the dust.""

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav today announced the name of the party contestant from Gorakhpur and said the candidate for Phulpur will be declared shortly. The Congress has already named its nominees for both the high-profile constituencies. Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha constituencies were vacated by Chief Minister Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya respectively, after they became members of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council. For the BJP, Gorakhpur assumes significance as it is the bastion of Adityanath, who has represented it in Lok Sabha five times. Prior to Adityanath, Gorakhpur was thrice represented in the Parliament by his mentor Avaidyanath. Phulpur, on the other hand, was once the bastion of the Congress, and represented by first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. It had for the first time witnessed a saffron surge in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when Maurya emerged victorious. ""We can clearly see that opposition votes will split with both the SP and the Congress in the fray. However, we will contest on our strengths, and emerge victorious. We believe that the hard work of the party workers will definitely help us to clinch victory on both the seats,"" UP BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla told   on Sunday. Even when the two parties (SP and Congress) fought against us jointly in the 2017 Assembly polls, their alliance came a cropper, he said. Shukla exuded confidence that BJP will not only retain the two seats, but also improve its margin of victory.

"The 72.13 percent voter turnout for the Karnataka Assembly elections has broken all records and is the highest recorded in the state since the 1952 polls, Chief Electoral Officer Sanjeev Kumar said on Saturday. The turnout was marginally better than the 2013 polls, which at 71.45 percent, was the previous highest recorded voter turnout in the last six Assembly elections in Karnataka. It was 65 percent in 2008 and 2004, 69 percent in 1989 and 1994, and 69 percent in the 1990 Assembly election. But while large numbers of people voted across Karnataka, the state capital Bengaluru stayed away, with only 51 percent of its electorate choosing to vote, even lower than 2013, when only 57.33 percent voted.

Five years later, in the 2013 Assembly elections, Bangalore Urban saw 52.83 percent turnout, while Bangalore Rural fared significantly better yet again, with 72.95 percent. Moreover, urban voters' apathy is an issue that isn't specific to Bengaluru; Mysuru, the state's second largest city, also saw voting percentage lower than the state's average. Although at 66.88 percent, it fared better than 2013, when 65.83 percent of Mysuru's electorate cast their votes, it was lower than the state's average, the report in   added. The other district with a below-par turnout was Gulbarga in northern Karnataka, where only 56.03 percent of the population voted in the Assembly election, a significant drop from the corresponding figure for 2013, when 63.75 percent did.

Another volunteer at Citizen Matters, Shree DN, said a door-to-door survey is required to fix the problem once and for all, since there are names of deceased individuals and also names of people under different spellings present on the lists. ""When the base is bloated, the voting figures cannot be genuine"", she added. Several parties also expressed apprehension about polling taking place on the second Saturday of the month, saying this too would impact voter turnout.

The president-elect thanked Prime Minister Imran Khan for nominating him and said he hoped to “get the chance to serve this post in its true spirit”,   reported. “Our government has a message of serving the masses,” Alvi said. “I am not the president of PTI alone, I am the president of all parties and all Pakistanis.

": The Congress hit back at Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, accusing him of ""lying"" on the issue of Non Performing Assets (NPAs) and dubbed him as a ""court jester"" writing ""wasteful"" blogs, after he called Rahul Gandhi a ""clown prince"" who was spreading ""lies"" about Modi government waiving Rs 2.5 lakh crore in loans to 15 industrialists. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused Jaitley of making desperate attempts at spreading ""fake agenda to stay relevant as a court jester"" and asked why he was ""abusing"" the Opposition instead of answering the questions on NPAs of banks and Rafale deal. Attacking the government on the issue of NPAs, the Congress leader alleged collusion between ""bank looters and the Modi government"". ""Political amnesia and chest thumping cannot obliterate your dismal record of dismantling India's economic progress or as also the surging NPAs resulting out of bankruptcy of economic vision of Modi Government,"" he said. He said Jaitley and the Modi government have been ""trapped"" on the Rafale issue and that is why they are resorting to abuse the Opposition. ""Arun Jaitley is desperate in his attempt to stay relevant as a ‘court jester' to ‘Modi Sultanate'. 'Abuse, diversion' and deception' are the desperate tools of a 'Lying - '."" ""Instead of hiding behind the cloak of expletives for the opposition, let finance minister coherently answer politically relevant issues,"" he said in a statement. Surjewala said the Finance Ministry in a reply in Parliament on 24 July, 2018 admitted that NPAs stood at Rs 2,51,054 crore when Congress-UPA demitted power and they have increased to a whopping Rs 9,61,962 crore by March 2018. As NPAs now stand as Rs 12,00,000 crore, he asked, ""Are you lying in your ‘fake agenda blogpost' today or did you lie in Parliament? The nation wants to know"". ""We dare you to publicly state the amount of loans given during the tenure of Modi Government in last 52 months, along with details as to how much of those loans have become NPAs? How much worth of loans were ‘ever-greened' and ‘restructured' during the tenure of Modi Government?"" the Congress leader said. He also asked how many ‘willful defaulters' escaped from India during last 52 months and with how much money. ""How many ‘economic offenders', ‘defaulters' and ‘looters' did you bring back to India and jailed?"" he asked. ""And yes  , the desperate quest to stay relevant of a ‘court jester' by wasteful blogs continues."" ""Please reply - Why hide behind abuse when trapped in Rafale maze? Why supersede HAL for Rs 30,000 crore contract? Why no answer on Rs 41,000 crore loss in Rafale scam?"" he said on Twitter. Surjewala also asked why was ‘Offset Contract' of Rs 30,000 crore given to a 12-day-old company and why a purchase of Rs 526 crore Rafale was made for Rs 1,670 crore and caused a loss of Rs 41,205 crore to the country. ""Why compromise national security by reducing aircraft from 126 to 36? Why did you violate the Defence Procurement Procedure? Why was no prior approval taken from Cabinet Committee on Security? Why did you sacrifice 'Transfer of Technology' to India? Why eight-year long delay for 'emergency purchase' of aircraft?"" he asked. Raising the Vijay Mallya issue, Surjewala asked, ""Did Mallya, an economic offender of Rs 9,091 crore, meet you on March 1, 2016 and tell you he was leaving India for London? Did Mallya not run away on 2 March, 2016?"" ""Were you not duty bound as Finance Minister to alarm the authorities and get Mallya arrested? Should your role then be not probed? Do you have any right to continue as Finance Minister? Should you not be sacked immediately?"" He said the truth is that the “ever depreciating ‘Rupee', the ever increasing fuel prices, the declining exports and extinguished savings, the phenomenally high current account deficit is your sad legacy and making the common people of India describe you as – 'Jaitley looted the pockets'."" Jaitley had earlier launched a scathing attack on the Congress president as he retorted to his charges made during political rallies. ""You lied on the Rafale deal, you lied on the NPAs. Your temperament to concoct facts raises a legitimate question – do people whose natural preference is falsehood deserve to be a part of the public discourse,"" he said in a Facebook blog. ""The world's largest democracy must seriously introspect whether public discourse should be allowed to be polluted by the falsehood of a Clown Prince,"" the BJP leader said.",Press Trust of India,FP Staff
"Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Left parliamentarians from the state staged a protest outside the Rail Bhavan on Friday against the Centre's decision to drop the proposal to establish a railway coach factory in Palakkad district of Central Kerala. Blaming the Centre for ""punishing"" the people of Kerala, the chief minister claimed that it was because the state was being ruled by the Left Democratic Front the central government made this decision. ""The coaches, which are currently used in Kerala, are worn-out and creaking. The Centre has decided that a coach factory is not needed at Palakkad, but it seems they have agreed to open one in Haryana,"" Vijayan said. He added that Union railway minister Piyush Goyal had recently said that his ministry had sought land for a coach factory in Uttar Pradesh. ""So they can open coach factories in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, that too new ones, but not in Kerala. This is solely because Kerala is ruled by the Left Democratic Front and the other two states are ruled by the BJP. ""Is this how a democratic country should function? Doesn't this amount to punishing the people of Kerala? Does this suit the federal system of the country? It shows that the Centre doesn't approve of democratic manners,"" the chief minister said. Vijayan's protest comes after the Prime Minister's Office   the Kerala chief minister for the fourth time in a row. Vijayan, who is currently in New Delhi to attend a CPM central committee meeting, was seeking an audience with the prime minister to discuss disparities in ration allocation to Kerala. However, according to the report on   the PMO had responded to Vijayan's request, saying that he could meet food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan if needed. Goyal had recently said that the Centre has no immediate plans to initiate construction of the Rs 550 crore rail coach factory in Kerala, the long-anticipated development project of the state. The Union minister had also said that the railways had adequate facilities to meet the coach requirements and that the present facilities could meet the future demands as well. The Left parliamentarians from the state, including Palakkad MP MB Rajesh, Idukki MP Joice George, Payyanur MP PK Sreemathy, Rajya Sabha MPs Elamaram Kareem and KK Ragesh, among others took part in the protest. Vijayan, who led the protest, said that this issue showed how the Centre was treating the states. ""How could the Centre torture a region? How could the Centre consider Kerala its enemy? How could the BJP and its leadership behave with enmity towards Kerala? This is not limited to Palakkad or Kerala. It's a national issue. It shows how the Centre is treating the states,"" Vijayan said. He said that Goyal and Prime Minister Modi must interfere in the matter. ""We are here today because of the promises not honoured for last 36 years. The promises were first made in 1982 by the then prime minister Indira Gandhi regarding the setting up of a coach factory in Palakkad,"" Vijayan said. State railway minister G Sudhakaran had earlier lashed out at the Centre in the Assembly and alleged that the Union government has given up the project even as a coach factory at Rae Bareilly had already been commissioned and a similar project for Chennai was being considered. The decision to set up the rail coach factory was announced in the 2008-9 Union Budget and state government had extended full support to the proposal. About 240 acres of land was acquired for the factory years ago.",FP Staff,Press Trust of India
" The West Bengal unit of the BJP on Tuesday slammed the TMC for ""murdering democracy"" in the state during Monday's panchayat polls that left at least 12 people dead and several injured. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh alleged that the law and order situation under the present government has completely collapsed in West Bengal. ""The TMC along with SEC (West Bengal State Election Commission) has murdered the democracy in the state. They have snatched away the democratic rights of the masses. If the TMC is so confident of the development it has done then why didn't it allow the masses to vote freely,"" Ghosh said. Widespread violence during the panchayat polls on Monday left at least 12 people dead and 43 injured, even as more than 73 percent of the electorate turned up to cast their vote. Opposition parties have accused the TMC of unleashing ""a reign of terror and destroying democracy"". The TMC has termed the allegations ""baseless"". ""Initially, they didn't allow people to file nominations. And those who managed to do so were threatened by TMC and were asked to withdraw. The people who didn't withdraw were attacked. This is nothing but a complete destruction of the democratic process in the state,"" he said.

"Indian economy has become like a car whose three tyres are punctured, former finance minister P Chidambaram said on Sunday, 3 June, in Thane as he attacked the Narendra Modi government on rising petroleum prices and other issues. ""Private investment, private consumption, exports and government expenditures are four growth engines of an economy. It's like four tyres of a car. If one or two tyres are punctured, it will slow down but in our case, three tyres are punctured,"" the senior Congress leader said at an event organised by the Maharashtra Congress unit. Government expenditure is on only in healthcare and in some other amenities, he said. ""To keep this expenditure going on, the government has continued taxing petrol, diesel and even LPG. It is squeezing money from people in such taxes and spending some from it on public amenities,"" Chidambaram said. Did you see any investment in the power sector recently, he questioned. ""For example, out of the 10 major companies that went into insolvency, five were steel companies. How can you expect any investment in such sectors,"" he wondered. Chidambaram also criticised the government for introducing a ""five-slab"" Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. He said that the government is incompetent in addressing the economic issues, which has ""worsened"" under the current dispensation. ""Industrial utilisation is mere 60 percent in the country. The export of merchandise, during the UPA was $315 billion, which was $303 billion last year. Before that, it was not even $300 billion. This shows we are not earning from exports too,"" the former finance minister said. ""The average amount of disbursed Mudra loan is Rs 43,000 per person. No major investment can be done with such low amount, except one wants to run a Pakoda stall,"" Chidambaram said in an apparent reference to Modi's remarks that selling 'pakodas' is also a form of employment.

"The Uttar Pradesh government has banned the use of polythene bags and items of common use made of plastic from 15 July, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Friday, 6 July. ""We have decided to ban plastic in the entire state from 15 July,"" he said on Twitter. ""I appeal that after 15 July plastic cups, glasses and polythene should not be used at any level. This will need the cooperation of all of you,"" the message in Hindi, released by the CM's office, said. Adityanath's tweet did not give further details. When contacted, officials said the modalities of the ban were being worked out and the concerned department has been asked to submit a blueprint as soon as possible, after which a meeting will be held with the chief minister. Details were being worked out to ensure that the ban can be enforced effectively, officials said. In December 2015, when the Akhilesh Yadav government was in power, the state Cabinet decided on an absolute ban on distribution, manufacture and sale of plastic and polythene bags with a thickness of more than 40 microns. However, by January 2016 many areas, including Noida on Delhi's outskirts, had failed to adhere to the guidelines and the ban could not be implemented seriously. It is not immediately clear if there are any exemptions to the latest ban and no penalties have been announced. The chief minister made the initial announcement earlier in the day in Barabanki while addressing a ‘van mahotsav’. The Maharashtra government announced on 23 March a ban on manufacture, use, sale, distribution and storage of plastic materials such as bags, spoons, plates and PET bottles. The ban in that state came into effect on 23 June, but the government later eased some of the restrictions. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Hrangturzo recorded 55 percent, South Tuipui 51 percent,  and Thorang 59 percent, the official said. Forty-two VVPATs, 25 ballot units and 19 control units were replaced, following malfunctions at various polling stations across Mizoram, Chief Electoral Officer Ashish Kundra said. Voter turn out was recorded at 45 percent in Aizawl district and at around 55 percent in Serchhip, chief electoral officer Ashish Kundra said. He said that the overall voter turnout in Mizoram was recorded at 50% till 1.30 pm. Former chief minister of Mizoram Zoramthanga, who was in power from 1998 to 2008, said that he was confident that his party MNF would win this time in a landslide victory. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla cast his vote at Zarkawt at around 12:15 pm. He is hopeful to win simple majority by bagging more than 27 seats. Thanhawla said the Congress would not forge post poll alliance with the BJP. Inspite of contesting in 39 seats, BJP will not win more than five seats in Mizoram this time, vice-president of BJP's Mahila Morcha in Mizoram Vijay Lakshmi Rai said. ""BJP's campaign was better this year but due to this 'Hinduva' tag on the party, we are going to lose in many seats. BJP has never won a seat here, so winning even 2-3 seats is good for us. I hope my party forms government with the help of other like-minded parties after the result,"" Rai said. The overall voter turnout for the 40-member Mizoram  Assembly polls was recorded at 29 percent until 11 am. Until 10.30 am on Wednesday, 664 Bru voters cast their votes at Kanhmun in Mizoram's Mamit district. Brisk polling is underway in Mizoram with nearly 25 percent of 7.68 lakh voters casting their votes in the first three hours on Wednesday, an official said. Men and women dressd in traditional attires were seen queued up outside the many polling stations in all districts well before voting began at 7 am. Around 25 percent of the 7,68,181 voters cast their votes by 10 am, Deputy Additional Chief Electoral Officer CC Lalchhuangkina told   over the phone quoting reports from all eight districts. ""Conducive situation and favourable weather helped the people to exercise their franchise smoothly,"" he added. ""Except for a few EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines)- VVPAT (Voters Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) device malfunctioning, no untoward incident was reported so far. ""Like previous elections, polling was absolutely peaceful. As Mizo society is very disciplined and Church guided, electioneering has always been incident-free in the state,"" he said. Congress has been trying to retain its grip on its last bastion in the North East. The grand old party has been in power since 2008 and is eyeing its third consecutive term, is being led by Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla, who in recent elections thwarted the BJP's attempts to gets its lotus to bloom in the Vidhan Sabha of this Christian-majority state. However, the BJP has reason to be optimistic. From anti-incumbency to alcohol, a variety of factors could make the Congress' quest to retain its hold on power more difficult. Mizoram witnessed a 15 percent voter turnout till 9 am, as per the Chief Election Commission. The voting process started at 7 am and will continue till 4 pm. Polling for Bru refugess will end at 3 pm. Mizoram's international borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh, as well as state borders with Tripura, Assam and Manipur, have been sealed since Sunday in view of the polls. Lalthanfela, a differently-abled first-time voter cast his vote at Zarkawt-II in Aizawl, and said that he hopes that Congress retains power in Mizoram. Young voters in the state want infrastructure development, improvement of road and education system. Incumbent chief minister Lal Thanhawla is also slated to cast his vote at Zarkawt-II in Aizawl, which falls under Aizawl North-III constituency. Of the 865 voters at this polling station, 107 voters have so far cast their votes since 7 am. The area's sitting Congress MLA Lal Thanzara, who also holds the health portfolio, cast his vote at 7 am as well. He was tipped against MNF nominee C Lalmuanpuia, BJP's VL Awia, ZPM candidate C Lalhmingthanga and Zoramthar Lalremsiama Ralte. Altogether, 47 of 1,179 polling booths have been classified as 'critical' and as many as 'vulnerable' by the Election Commission. Mizoram Bru Displaced People's Forum demanded setting up a special polling station in a relief camp in Tripura's Kanchanpur to help pregnant women, senior citizens and differently abled people to cast their votes. The Forum's General Secretary Bruno Msha said that the election commission has been made aware of the demand on Tuesday. However, chief electoral officer Ashish Kundra confirms that there are 12,026 Bru voters coming from relief camps in Tripura. Former Mizoram chief minister and MNF leader Zoramthanga rules out the possibility of a hung Assembly, adding that he was confident enough to form the party. He also said that one of the promises that the party would keep is the ban of liquor. ""Congress had failed the Church and the people by selling liquor,"" Zoramthanga said. Eight parties are in the fray for the 40-member Mizoram Assembly. Polling started for the Mizoram Assembly election at 7 am on Wednesday. The total number of candidates this time is 209, almost 67 higher than 2013. Mizo National Front (MNF) Leader Zoramthanga will cast his vote at Aizwal's Ramhlun Venglai. The MNF is an integral regional party which was in power for two terms between 1998-2003 and 2003-2008. The state's electorate is 7,68,181. Gearing up its entire machinery for assembly polls in Mizoram, the authorities have decided to connect all polling booths through wireless communication for the first time leaving no ""shadow areas"" at all. Mizoram, having a difficult hilly terrain, is going for assembly elections on Wednesday to elect 40 MLAs. ""For the first time in Mizoram's election history, all polling booths will be covered by wireless communication. It will help in timely reporting of every development and progress of the polling,"" Mizoram Deputy Inspector General of Police (Training & Armed Branch) Joseph Lalchhuana told   in an interview. Till the last election in 2014 for the Lok Sabha, not all areas were connected through wireless technology and there was a delay in receiving information from far-flung booths, he added. Lalchhuana, who is also the Assistant State Police Nodal Officer for the assembly elections, said: ""By doing this (wireless connection), we have eliminated all shadow areas from Mizoram. Shadow areas means the place where there is no communication."" For operating the system as per the Election Commission of India guidelines, special training sessions were conducted for the Mizoram Police personnel and now everything is in place to conduct the polls efficiently, he added. ""We take pride in it. We have tested it under the direct supervision of our DGP Balaji Srivastava and are fully confident of supporting the Election Commission as and when required,"" Lalchhuana said. Mizoram has 7,70,395 registered voters who will cast their franchise in 1,164 polling booths across the state, while an additional 15 special booths have been created at Kanhmun village in Mamit district for the Bru refugees coming from six camps in Tripura. Lalchhuana said that during the poll campaigning, which ended last evening, the Mizoram Police had formed 84 flying squads, 39 dynamic check posts, 80 static surveillance teams and 80 quick response teams across the state to prevent any unlawful activities. ""We have over 50 zonal police officers in the rank of DSP to SP. They are looking at the macro security arrangements in their respective areas. Above them, we have four grid DIGs along with the existing two range DIGs for overall responsibility,"" he added. Mizoram has 38 police stations and it has recently set up five new outposts for ease of surveillance and confidence-building among voters. ""The total sanctioned strength of Mizoram Police is around 13,000 personnel, but we have around 9,000 persons at present. They all will be involved in the poll process,"" the DIG said. Mizoram Police is being assisted in its poll-related activities by 40 companies of central armed police forces (CAPF), comprising personnel from BSF, SSB, CRPF and Assam Police. Lalchhuana said special attention has been given along the state's borders with Assam, Manipur and Tripura, while the Mizoram DGP has sought cooperation from his counterparts in these states. ""At four inter-state border points, we are monitoring the movement of people through CCTV. This is a new initiative and we installed it before the poll process started,"" he added. Lalchhuana also praised the public for cooperation in overall peace-keeping efforts during the election campaign across the state. He appreciated the people for depositing their licenced arms as soon as the election notification was announced despite this being the harvest season that typically sees attacks by wild boars on farmers' produce. ""We are repeatedly thanking the people for their cooperation. Mizoram has a track record of holding free and fair polls in the past. I had joined in 1986 and since then, I have witnessed no violence before or after the polling or after declaration of results,"" Lalchhuana said. The ruling Congress and the main opposition party Mizo National Front (MNF) have fielded 40 candidates each, while the BJP is looking to open its account in the state for the first time by contesting in 39 seats. The Zoram Peoples Movement (ZPM), an alliance formed by two political parties and four groups, is contesting in 35 seats. Counting of votes will be taken up on 11 December. Ahead of the voting to elect a new Assembly in Congress-ruled Mizoram on Wednesday, the authorities on Tuesday sealed India's borders along the northeastern state with Myanmar and Bangladesh, an official said here on Tuesday. A senior Mizoram Police official said that around 11,100 security personnel comprising central paramilitary and state security forces have been deployed to further tighten the security to foil any attempt to create any trouble during the Wednesday's polling. ""In view of the Assembly polls, BSF and Assam Rifles troopers have been asked to seal Mizoram's borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar and further intensify their vigil along the international frontiers to prevent any kind of cross-border movements by inimical elements,"" Mizoram's Joint Chief Electoral Officer Zorammuana told  . He said: ""Following the directions of the Election Commission, the authorities also asked the security forces to further tighten the security along Mizoram's inter-state borders with Tripura, Assam and Manipur. No movement other than of those associated with the election process would be allowed at the inter-state borders."" Mizoram shares 310-kilometre unfenced borders with Bangladesh and 510-kilometre boundaries with Myanmar without any fencing. The Border Security Force (BSF) troopers have been deployed along the Bangladesh borders, while the Assam Rifles, under the Army, have been posted along at the Myanmar borders. Zorammuana said around 7,075 electoral officials have been engaged to conduct the elections from 7 am to 4 pm Chief Electoral Officer Ashish Kundra said in Aizawl that the electoral officials escorted by security personnel have already reached all the 1,164 polling stations across the state. The Election Commission has set up 15 special polling stations at Kanhmun, a village along the Mizoram-Tripura border, to facilitate voting by Reang tribal refugees, sheltered in Tripura for the past 21 years. Of the over 35,000 tribal immigrants, 11,232 are eligible to cast their votes in the Assembly elections. The CEO said that around 40 all-women managed polling stations have been set up across the constituencies in which the entire polling staff, including the police and security personnel, are women. ""The VVPAT (Voters Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) machines would be used along with EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) in all the 40 constituencies to enhance transparency and credibility of the elections,"" Kundra told the media. Unlike in other states of the country, Church-backed Mizoram People's Forum (MPF) plays a unique role in ensuring free and fair elections in Christian-dominated Mizoram. Started in 2006, it launched an initiative equipped with a mechanism to name and shame any wrongdoing by a candidate or any individual on community loudspeakers for one and all to know. Significantly, the entire exercise is sincerely followed by each member of the deeply religious Mizo society. A total of 209 candidates, 67 higher than in 2013 state polls, are in the fray for the Wednesday's elections to the 40-member Mizoram Assembly. Of the 209 candidates, 15 are women. In 2013, only six women had contested and none were successful. Like the previous elections, women voters once again outnumber the men in Mizoram. Of the 768,181 voters, there are 393,685 women and 374,496 men. The five-year term of the Mizoram Assembly ends on 15 December. Besides two national parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), many regional and local parties have fielded candidates in most of the 40 Assembly constituencies. They include main opposition Mizo National Front (MNF), People's Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram (PRISM), Zoram People's Movement (ZPM) and Meghalaya-based National People's Party (NPP). However, the main contest is likely to take place between the ruling Congress and the MNF. The Congress has been in power, except for 10 years, since the Mizoram become a full-fledged state in 1987. The MNF, a constituent of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), ruled during those 10 years -- 1998-2003 and 2003-2008.

"The Supreme Court of Maldives on Sunday said there is no legal obstruction to execute its order on releasing jailed Opposition leaders, the  reported.

The Supreme Court later overruled the order to arrest Saeed.    The Opposition condemned Anil’s statement and termed it an “illegal takeover of the Maldivian state”.

Statements made today by AG Anil, CDF Shiyam and Acting CP Nawaz, to disobey SC orders is tantamount to a coup. They, and President Yameen must resign immediately. Security services must uphold the constitution and serve the Maldivian people. President Gayoom had said on Saturday that he was ready to hold early presidential elections to allow voters to decide who should lead their country.

At present, Nasheed lives in Sri Lanka. Most of the president’s other political rivals, who had not gone in exile, were jailed. Gayoom, however, had a fallout with his half-brother and lawmakers loyal to Maumoon Abdul Gayoom have now joined forces with Nasheed against the president.

On 16 July, a single bench of the high court, presided over by Justice A M Badar, had reserved the verdict on five revision applications challenging the discharge granted in the case by a trial court to Gujarat IPS officer Rajkumar Pandian, former Gujarat ATS chief D G Vanzara, Gujarat police officer N K Amin, Rajasthan cadre IPS officer Dinesh M N and Rajasthan police constable Dalpat Singh Rathod. Justice Badar had been conducting hearings on a daily basis since 4 July on the five revision pleas filed by Sohrabuddin Shaikh's brother Rubabuddin Shaikh and the CBI. Rubabuddin Shaikh had filed three of these five pleas, challenging the discharge granted in the case by the trial court to Pandian, Dinesh and Vanzara. The remaining two pleas were filed by the CBI challenging the discharge granted to Amin and Rathod. The Gujarat Police had then claimed Sohrabuddin Shaikh had terror links. Between 2014 and 2017, a special court in Mumbai, where the case was shifted from Gujarat following a Supreme Court order, discharged 15 of these 38 accused. Those discharged included 14 police officials and BJP president Amit Shah. As per the CBI charge sheet, Sohrabuddin Shaikh, a suspected gangster based in Gujarat, and Kausar Bi were abducted by officers of the Gujarat ATS and the Rajasthan Police from near Hyderabad, and killed in a fake encounter in November 2005. Prajapati, an eye-witness to these killings, was shot dead in another staged encounter in December 2006 by some Rajasthan Police officials at the behest of the Gujarat and Rajasthan officers, who had been involved in the killing of the husband-wife duo, the CBI had claimed. Justice Badar also conducted a separate hearing on a discharge plea filed by Gujarat IPS officer Vipul Aggarwal. A co-accused in the Sohrabuddin Shaikh encounter case, Aggarwal's discharge plea was rejected by the trial court in 2017. He then approached the HC challenging the order, seeking parity with the others who have been discharged. The verdict in Aggarwal's case is also likely to be pronounced Monday, 10 September. The encounter cases of Sohrabuddin Shaikh and Kausar Bi, and Prajapati were clubbed together in 2013 after the apex curt directed that the trial be shifted to Mumbai from Gujarat.

"Kings XI Punjab defeated Delhi Daredevils by four runs in a last-ball finish after they restricted them to 139/8 in match number 22 of the Indian Premier League on 23 April at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground in Delhi. Kings XI Punjab got off to a rough start, after Delhi Daredevils won the toss and put them to bat. Aaron Finch got out in the second over, falling to a ball from youngster Avesh khan. The next to go was in-form Lokesh Rahul, who was caught by Avesh Khan off a ball from Liam Plunkett, who was making his IPL debut. Mayank Agarwal (21), who was Plunkett’s next victim, was clean bowled in the 8th over. Kings XI Punjab were 61/3 in 8 overs. Karun Nair and Yuvraj Singh’s stitched a 25-run partnership, before Yuvraj was caught by Rishabh Pant off a ball from Avesh Khan. Yuvraj's fall brought Karun Nair in the middle, who showed a little fight against the hosts and slammed 34 runs to take his team past the 100-run mark before falling in the 17th over to Plunkett. Delhi's Daniel Christian also joined the party and dismissed David Miller (26) with Punjab's scorecard reading 127/6. Meagre contributions by Punjab skipper Ravichandran Ashwin (6 runs off 7 balls), Andrew Tye (3) and with the help of 14 extra runs, Punjab managed to put 143. Delhi started their proceedings on a shaky note as pacer Ankit Rajpoot came with the first breakthrough for Punjab in the third over, dismissing opener Prithvi Shaw for 22 runs. Incoming batter Glen Maxwell (12) and skipper Gautam Gambhir (4) once again struggled to gather runs as both were back in the dug-out in the fifth and sixth over respectively, leaving Delhi at 42/3. Gambhir's dismissal brought Shreyas Iyer in the middle, who tried his best to change Delhi's fortune, but lacked partnership from the other end. Afghan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman struck in the ninth over to dismiss in-form Rishabh Pant (4) cheaply. All-rounder Daniel Christian (6) was the next to fall for Delhi. However, Iyer kept the scoreboard ticking. With the match slipping from Delhi's hand as the host were reeling at 76/5, Iyer and Rahul Tewatia (24 off 21 balls) stiched a 47-run partnership for the sixth wicket, bringing back the host back in the contest. As the low-scoring issue went into the final over with Delhi needing 17 runs, Iyer six off the first delivery gave Delhi a ray of hope. However, Iyer failed to give a finishing touch to his fighting knock as Delhi fell short of the 144-run target by four runs.         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Mr Athawale claimed that the Shiv Sena would suffer ""massive"" defeats if it chose to go alone in the Lok Sabha and Maharashtra Assembly polls. The Union minister said his party was in talks with the BJP for contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai South Central, Satara and some other seats in Maharashtra. ""If the Shiv Sena remains in the NDA, they can leave the Mumbai South Central seat that I have decided to contest. If, however, they severe the ties with us, the RPI will stake claims over three-four seats in Maharashtra,"" he said. However, the RPI was planning to independently contest on some seats in the upcoming Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and support the BJP on the remaining seats, he said. Mr Athawale voiced support to the Centre's move to send two top Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials, including its director, on leave following a spat between them. ""Had they not fought (with each other), they would not have been removed. (Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi's allegation that their removal was linked to the Rafale deal is baseless,"" he said.

"Hours after the AIADMK unveiled a portrait of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in the state Assembly on Monday, 12 February, opposition DMK filed a petition in the High Court against it, reported ANI. Jayalalithaa’s portrait is the 11th to be installed in the Assembly. It was unveiled by Speaker P Dhanapal in the presence of Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam at around 9:30 am. Opposition DMK, along with ally Congress, boycotted the unveiling, citing that her portrait cannot be installed as the former CM had been convicted in a disproportionate assets case. Jayalalithaa, who passed away in December 2016, was accused in a disproportionate assets case, in which her longtime aide VK Sasikala is a serving a four-year jail term. At the time of announcing the judgment in the case, the Supreme Court had abated Jayalalithaa on account of her death. DMK’s working president MK Stalin took to Twitter to condemn the installation, calling the former chief minister a “corrupt” person. He pointed that flashing  ’ packets to make a point about them being easily available was considered a “violation” by the Assembly, but a portrait of a “convict” was not. Chief Minister Palaniswami defended the decision to install Jayalalithaa's portrait, saying it would be a great honour for the Assembly as she was committed to the people's welfare. He added that by being elected as the chief minister for six times, she was regarded as a role model by many. Tweeting a poem about Jayalalithaa, the chief minister said that there was “no doubt” that her legacy will continue to live. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi was invited to unveil the portrait in 2017, he did not accept the invitation, sources said. A Public Interest Litigation against placing portraits of convicted leaders in government buildings is pending in the Madras High Court.

"Ruling NDA candidate and JD(U) member Harivansh Narayan Singh was on Thursday elected as the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, securing 125 votes as against 105 polled by opposition candidate BK Hariprasad. The post of the deputy chairman was lying vacant since the retirement of PJ Kurien on 1 July. Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu began the proceedings on Thursday, inviting MPs to submit the motion proposing a colleague's name for the constitutional position. The nomination of Harivansh was proposed by MP Ram Prasad Singh and BJP president Amit Shah among others. Shortly after general secretary of the Upper House, Desh Deepak Verma explained the voting process, members of the House participated in a voice vote followed by a division of votes. Naidu held the voting twice, after a few MPs complained that they couldn't register their vote on the machine. After the results of 125 votes for Harivansh Narayan Singh against 105 votes for Congress' BK Hariprasad were announced, the entire House congratulated the former with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Leader of the House Arun Jaitley and Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad felicitating him. Jaitley, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar and senior Congress leader Azad accompanied Harivansh to the seat designated for the Deputy Chairman in the House, which is next to that of the Leader of Opposition. Addressing the House, Azad said the deputy chairman must support the Opposition as they are more ""undernourished"". ""In elections, some on wins and someone loses. But the Deputy Chairman is no longer a part of any single party. He belongs to the country now. In fact, I believe that Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the House should in-fact support the Opposition as they are more undernourished than that of the ruling party,"" he said. Prime Minister Modi also congratulated Harivansh on his election. Speaking on the occasion, Modi talked about achievements of Harivansh, a journalist for about four decades. ""Today we mark the anniversary of the Quit India Movement. Harivansh   hails from Ballia, a land linked with freedom fighters. He has been inspired by Loknayak JP. He also spent time in Varanasi. Here is a leader who worked with a statesman like (former prime minister) Chandra Shekhar  . Working closely with Chandra Shekhar  , Harivansh   knew in advance that Chandra Shekhar   would resign. However, he did not let his own paper have access to this news. This shows his commitment to ethics and public service. He is a learned man. He has read a lot of books and has also written extensively,"" he said. Harivansh, 62, is the  , one of the most prominent newspapers of Bihar and Jharkhand, which for years championed the cause of special category status for Bihar. He left the daily after becoming a Rajya Sabha member in 2014. Hoping that Harivansh would do justice to all members of the House, Modi in a lighter vein said the situation in the House is such that the umpire faces more problems than players. He also said that Harivansh was offered a job by the Reserve Bank of India but he did not take it. Speaking about the JD(U) leader's experience, Modi added, ""His experience, commitment and expertise of dealing people will help the House. He had earlier run a column on how the parliamentarians of the country should work. Little did he know that he will one day be the Deputy Chairperson of the House. We all will benefit from his experience."" The prime minister said while the outcome of the election was known, yet there was a contest as per procedures and the new members got training on how to vote in the House. Union minister Arun Jaitley, who attended the proceedings in the Rajya Sabha for the first time since undergoing a renal transplant in May, said the newly-elected deputy chairman never made personal attacks on anyone and hoped that he would further better the discourse in the House. Born on 30 June, 1956, in Uttar Pradesh's Balia, Harivansh did his post-graduate in Economics from Banaras Hindu University (BHU). He also did his PG Diploma in Journalism from BHU. He has been an associate of renowned socialist Jai Prakash Narayan. House chairman Naidu also congratulated Harivansh, outlining his reticent nature and encouraged him to work for the country, and not any particular party ideology. ""For all those who think that I get emotional in the House, let me assure that Harivansh is a calm person. It is exemplary that he has been elected for the post despite being a first-time lawmaker. I congratulate the House for completing the election before the Monsoon Session is completed. Being a chairperson, I can suggest to him that we should neither look left nor right and work only for the country,"" Naidu remarked. Soon after, Harivansh addressed the House and extended his gratitude and asserted that he belonged to neither party as a Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. ""Now that I have been designated to this role, I belong to neither of the party. But I take this opportunity to thank the party that has given me this opportunity. I would also like to thank PM Modi and Arun Jaitley who came to Rajya Sabha today (Thursday),"" he said. The former journalist also expressed his nervousness and said he never imagined he would hold an office in the Parliament as important as this. ""I have learned a lot working with you all, and am certain that it will help me deal with matters better. I am also nervous because I will be working with Parliamentarians who come with a lot of experience and knowledge,"" he said. Harivansh later presided over the proceedings of the House and was applauded with thumping of desks by members. He, thereafter, adjourned the House till 2 pm.",FP Staff,FP Staff
" Under mounting pressure for honouring his pre-poll promise of waiving farm loans of Rs 53,000 crore, Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy has called a meeting of farmers' organisations on Wednesday to discuss the issue, officials said. Kumaraswamy will hold a meeting with representatives of farmers' groups and agriculturists to discuss loan waiver, farmer suicides, and other problems faced by them, officials at the Chief Minister's Office said. Deputy chief minister G Parameshwara will also attend the meeting, they said, adding that Leader of Opposition in the Assembly BS Yeddyurappa has also been invited. Kumaraswamy on Tuesday chaired a meeting of senior officers on the issue that was attended by Chief Secretary K Ratna Prabha, Additional Chief Secretary (Finance) ISN Prasad, Development Commissioner DV Prasad, and Additional Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister M Lakshminarayana. The chief minister had recently said he was committed to waiving farm loans or else would retire from politics, and asked people not to fall prey to the ""BJP's conspiracy"". He had also said he was ready with the guidelines on loan waiver details of which will be disclosed on Wednesday. Seeking to turn the heat on Kumaraswamy, the BJP had appealed to farmers and the public to ""voluntarily observe a bandh"" across Karnataka on Monday to protest the ""failure"" of the chief minister to honour his farm loan waiver promise within 24 hours of coming to power, but it had evoked a tepid response. Kumaraswamy, who had made the promise in the run-up to the elections, later sought time, saying since he was heading a coalition government with the Congress he would have to consult the alliance partner before taking a decision. He had also said he would have to take into account the financial condition of the state before taking the decision. Putting the new government on notice, Yeddyurappa has threatened to take the next course of action if Kumaraswamy failed to deliver on his promise within a week. According to experts and senior government officials, the promise, if met, will have a huge impact on the state's financial health. Kumaraswamy has called the meeting with peasant groups at a time when there is still no clarity over the cabinet expansion amid reports of lack of consensus in the ruling coalition over the allocation of key portfolios, especially finance. The JD(S) is reportedly insisting on keeping the finance portfolio, which the Congress also wants.",PTI,FP Staff
": The Congress on Monday blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani for the attacks and violence on migrant workers in Gujarat and said they should quit if they are unable to carry out their responsibilities. The Opposition also trained its guns on Modi, saying how he would go to Varanasi and face the people of the state who made him the prime minister, after attacks on migrant labour from Uttar Pradesh in Gujarat, a state of which he was the chief minister for long. Congress President Rahul Gandhi held the targeting of migrant workers in Gujarat as ""completely wrong"". Taking to Twitter, he claimed the root cause of violence in Gujarat was the closure of factories and unemployment in the state. ""There is nothing more frightening than poverty. The root cause of the violence in Gujarat is the closed down factories and unemployment there. Both the system and that economy are reeling. Making migrant labour their target is completely wrong. I stand totally against it,"" Rahul tweeted. Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi alleged the ""politics of exclusion"" continues in Gujarat, while the concerned BJP chief ministers have done nothing to protect the interests of their constituents. ""I directly hold Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi responsible for this kind of violence and incidents on migrant labour and the kind of pressure being put on them.  If they do not take responsibility for this and provide the 'Ram Rajya' that they claimed, then they should quit their posts as they have no moral right to continue and hold such important positions and undertake responsibilities,"" she told reporters. Chaturvedi alleged this is the BJP's mindset, wherever it gets to power. ""I want to ask Modi ji as to what he is doing on this. You became the prime minister from Uttar Pradesh and sought votes in Bihar and now you are harrassing them and are trying to send them home,"" she said. ""Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is used by Modi only for political gains, while in Gujarat, people of these states are mistreated. Modi was elected to the Parliament through Varanasi, but what is he doing to protect the livelihood of these people?,"" she said, alleging this phenomenon has been seen in Maharashtra too. She charged Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray was also talking of removing people from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan from Maharashtra. 
She also said in Assam certain sections were being targeted in the name of NRC. Meanwhile, additional forces were deployed in industrial areas in Gujarat for the security of Hindi-speaking migrants after attacks on them sparked their exodus that prompted the state government on Monday to make an appeal for their return. Assuring security to the migrants, the Gujarat government said 431 people were arrested and 56 FIRs registered in connection with the attacks, as Vijay Rupani appealed to people not to engage in violence. Claiming that no untoward incident had taken place during the last 48 hours, Rupani said the situation has been brought under control by police. ""We are committed to maintaining law and order, and people can call police in case of trouble. We will provide them security."" he told reporters in Rajkot. Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - Yogi Adityanath and Nitish Kumar respectively - and Union minister and BJP ally Ram Vilas Paswan, who hails from Bihar, spoke to Rupani to voice their concern over the attacks.

" Days after a fresh push by the prime minister on simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, Chief Election Commissioner Om Prakash Rawat on Tuesday had a word of caution saying, the legal framework required to hold the two elections together will take a ""lot of time"" to get ready. Rawat, who took over as the CEC on Tuesday, said he would be the wrong person to respond as to whether simultaneous polls could be held in 2019. ""We cannot put the cart before the horse. Logistical issues are subservient to the legal framework. Unless legal framework is in place, we don't have to talk about anything else because the legal framework will take a lot of time—making the constitutional amendment to (changing) the la—all the process will take time,"" he said. He said once the legal framework is ready, the EC will deliver. ""... EC is a creation of the Constitution. We have to perform willy-nilly, deliver the election, whatever way prescribed in the law,"" he said. On being asked whether simultaneous polls could be held as early as in 2019, Rawat said he was the wrong person to answer this. He said in 2015, the poll panel was asked by the government about the feasibility of simultaneous polls and the commission made it clear that it would require an amendment to the Constitution and election laws and would require a certain number of EVMs, poling personnel, Rs 9,000 core besides other logistics. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had been batting for holding Lok Sabha and Assembly polls together, had recently said that like festivals, elections should be held on fixed dates so that governments can function for five years. He had also said that barbs exchanged during campaigning in one state have a bearing in other parts of the country which are not going to polls. Responding to a question on government rejecting Election Commission's demand for contempt power, Rawat said the commission was of the view that when unfounded, baseless allegations are levelled against it, it vitiates the atmosphere and affects the minds of the electorate. ""For that Election Commission should have those powers, it may serve some purpose. But the government said it won't be appropriate. And we have not said anything after that. Today, we don't have any such thing in mind (to reiterate our demand),"" he said. He said the Election Commission had stopped seeding of voter identity I-cards with Aadhaar following a Supreme Court directive.

Air Force One touched down at Helsinki Airport at 20:55 (local time) carrying Trump ahead of the historic meeting with Putin scheduled for Monday. He was greeted by the US Ambassador to Finland Robert Pence before travelling to his overnight lodgings, media reports said. Earlier, he had tweeted before leaving for the capital of Finland. “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” he said. “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Democrats know how to do is resist and obstruct!

" The Election Commission said on Monday that it would provide ""satisfactory solution"" to the concerns raised by political parties on the reliability of electronic voting machines (EVMs), after several of them pitched for returning to the ballot paper system at an all-party meeting. Briefing reporters after the meeting, Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat said, ""We will definitely look into all the suggestions given by them (political parties) and there will be a satisfactory solution to them."" The Election Commission convened the meeting ahead of elections to several state Assemblies later this year and the Lok Sabha polls scheduled for early next year. It is customary for the poll panel to listen to political parties ahead of elections. In the meeting, several Opposition parties raised the issues of EVM tampering and technical glitches in the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) system. Representatives of the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Trinamool Congress were among those who raised these issues and many of them also suggested going back to the ballot paper system, representatives of parties and EC officials present in the meeting said. Though EVM tampering and VVPAT glitches were not on the agenda, parties raised these issues. Some parties also suggested that the number of constituencies where results of EVM and paper audit trail device are matched be increased to enhance the confidence of voters and parties in the reliability of the voting mode. ""Nothing final has been decided yet, but one way to allay fears is to increase the number of constituencies where EVM and paper trail machine results are matched,"" a senior Election Commission functionary said after the meeting. Responding to repeated questions on EVMs, Rawat said the Election Commission takes a comprehensive view. ""Some of the parties said going back to ballot is really bad as it will bring back booth capturing...we don't want (that). At the same time, some parties said there are problems with EVMs, there are issues with VVPAT slip count so why not Election Commission takes a call on this,"" Rawat said. Asked about the stand of the Election Commission on EVMs and whether it remains the ""same"" as it was in the past, the chief election commissioner dubbed it as a ""hypothetical question"". In June last year, when the Election Commission had invited parties to prove that the EVMs can be hacked, only two parties accepted the challenge but they too opted out of the event. As many as 13 parties had last year questioned the reliability of the EVMs. Then chief election commissioner Nasim Zaidi had maintained that the EVMs used by the Election Commission were ""non-tamperable"" and with 100 percent use of paper trail machines in all future elections the issue of tamperability of the machines ""stands closed"". The ""failure rate"" of EVMs in most elections has been 0.7 percent. EVMs were first used in election in India in May, 1982 in a Kerala byoll. But since there was no law prescribing its use, the Supreme Court struck down the election. The Representation of the People Act was amended in 1989 to allow use of EVMs. But a general consensus on its use was evolved only in 1998. Over 11 percent of the 10,300 VVPAT machines across 10 states had developed faults and had to be replaced during the bypolls on 28 May this year. This prompted the EC to make ingenious changes to ensure that the failure rate goes down. Voter-verifiable paper audit trail machines dispense a slip with the symbol of the party for which a person has voted for. The slip appears on a small window for seven seconds and then drops in a box. But the voter cannot take it home. VVPATs are used in all polling stations. But as of now, results of EVMs and VVPATs are matched in one polling station per constituency.",Press Trust of India,PTI

It is posted for further hearing on 22 February 2018. The SC observed that they cannot club or combine criminal law issues with the question of whether Hadiya’s marriage to Shafin Jahan is valid or not.

The Kerala High Court had annulled Hadiya’s marriage to her husband Shafin Jahan in December 2016. A year later, the Supreme Court ruled that Hadiya was free to meet whoever she desired and allowed her to complete her medical school internship, while also allowing the NIA to continue its probe into allegations of “religious conversion.” In December 2017, the NIA had   Shafin Jahan, in connection with the probe into the alleged forced religious conversion and ‘love jihad’.

"Senior BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha, on Sunday, 17 June, was yet again at loggerheads with his own party, this time over Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s ongoing dharma at the Lieutenant Governor’s office. In a series of tweets, Sinha lashed out at the Central government for not letting the CMs of West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh meet Kejriwal at the L-G’s office. Highlighting that the CM’s were ‘elected and not selected’, Sinha said that by denying them entry, the government had made a ‘blatant show of autocracy, despotism, autarchy and use of power’. He also called for the demand of ‘Full statehood for Delhi’ to be fulfilled, keeping in mind the larger interest of the people of Delhi and the nation. Lauding ‘Arvind’s commitment, determination and image’ in his last tweet, Sinha ended his tirade by stating that he hopes good sense would prevail upon the administration. Sinha’s tweet storm is the latest in his scathing attacks against his own party. His differing views in the past have also led to speculations over his split from the saffron party. Earlier this month, Sinha, who is the Lok Sabha MP from Patna Sahib in Bihar, made a clear statement regarding his opinion over the state government by giving CM Nitish Kumar’s Iftar party a miss for the gathering at Tej Pratap Yadav’s residence.

" The Delhi high court on April 9 sought the Centre’s response on a plea alleging that the Union health ministry had illegally closed graft cases of thousands of crores and connected disciplinary proceedings against some former senior officials of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) without the approval of the competent authority – the prime minister of India. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C. Hari Shankar issued notice to the Centre and sought its reply by July 31 on the application by an NGO. The NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), has claimed that all corruption cases, some in relation to over Rs 6,000 crore worth of infrastructure development at the AIIMS, against the bureaucrats were being illegally closed without following the due procedure and without approval of the competent disciplinary authority – the prime minister, as he is in charge of the Department of Personnel and Training. The application has been moved by the NGO in its main petition for expeditious and objective investigation into alleged major corruption cases at the AIIMS during the years 2012-14 involving senior bureaucrats. In its latest application, filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan, CPIL has sought directions to the Centre to immediately refer the cases of corruption to the competent disciplinary authority for passing well reasoned orders. The NGO has claimed that the previous health minister, Harshvardhan, as well as the CBI had recommended major penalty proceedings against some AIIMS officials in connection with alleged financial irregularities at the premier hospital here. It has also said that former health minister Gulam Nabi Azad too had approved departmental proceedings against one of the bureaucrats for alleged financial irregularities and that case too has been closed by merely cautioning the official in question. “It is apparent from the above mentioned closure of corruption cases .. by Union Health Ministry, without even the matter being referred for consideration of competent disciplinary authority as per statute, that no fair decision is being taken in respect of these cases under the influence of the Respondent No.3 (J P Nadda),” the application said and sought summoning of records of the graft cases that were closed without the competent authority’s approval. Besides a CBI probe into the graft cases, the NGO in its main petition has also sought recusal of Nadda from acting as a disciplinary authority, alleging that he had “unfettered powers to influence the course of proceedings in all the corruption cases”. Nadda had earlier told the high court that the PIL was “actuated by ulterior motive” to gain political mileage and “malign” the government’s image.

CPM secretary-general Sitaram Yechury, who was in Patna to brief workers on the party Congress held in Hyderabad in April, said his party's main objective for the next general election would be to defeat the BJP-led ruling National Democratic Alliance. With that in view, the CPM's strategy would be to avoid any split of anti-BJP votes, Yechury told reporters. ""We are open to having an alliance with all parties opposed to the BJP in Bihar and elsewhere. Our only condition is we should get a respectable share of seats,"" he said.

Rao, one of the five rights activists arrested in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case, was so far under house arrest in Hyderabad. Joint Commissioner of Police (Pune) Shivaji Bodakhe said an extension of his house arrest, granted by the Hyderabad high court, expired on November 15. On October 26, Pune police had taken into custody activists Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves, while Sudha Bharadwaj was taken into custody the next day. Activists Rao, Ferreira, Gonsalves, Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha were arrested on August 28 after Pune police conducted raids at various places in the country in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence case.

Assistant Commissioner of Police Shivaji Pawar, the investigating officer, said a court in Hyderabad dismissed Rao’s application against the transit warrant obtained by Pune police on Friday. “He will be produced before a court in Pune on Sunday,” the officer added.

" Dalit leader Mayawati, whose Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is contesting this month's Chhattisgarh Assembly polls in alliance with former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janta Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC-J), Sunday accused the ""casteist"" BJP and the Congress of trying to ""abolish"" the reservation system. Addressing a rally in Taraud village in the Akaltara constituency in Janjgir-Champa, the BSP chief alleged that both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress had worked towards making reservation ""ineffective"" and were trying to gradually ""abolish"" it. ""Dalits, Adivasis and the other backward castes people have been getting the benefits of reservation, particularly in government jobs, as a result of the efforts of BR Ambedkar,"" Mayawati said. She accused the Congress and the BJP of having a ""casteist mentality"". ""Right from the beginning, those parties had a casteist mentality...they have worked towards making reservation ineffective and (are trying to) gradually abolish it,"" the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said. The BSP is contesting the election — to be held in two phases on 12 and 20 November — in alliance with the JCC-J and the Communist Party of India (CPI). Of the 90 Assembly seats in Chhattisgarh, the BSP will contest 33, the JCC-J 55 and the CPI two. Jogi has been named as the chief ministerial candidate of the coalition. His daughter-in-law, Richa Jogi, is contesting from the Akaltara seat on a BSP ticket. ""The Congress was in power for a long time in the country. Now, the incumbent BJP governments at the Centre and in the state have failed to fully comply with the quota norms as provisioned in the reservation policy. A similar situation is prevailing in Chhattisgarh as well,"" the BSP chief said. She also accused the Congress and the BJP of having an ""internal nexus"" to make reservations in job promotions for Dalits and tribals ""ineffective up to a great extent"". Mayawati further said the BSP had fought for reservation inside Parliament and on the streets, apart from running a campaign for the implementation of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission to ensure a quota for the OBCs. She also lashed out at the BJP and the Congress over the SCs, STs and OBCs not getting a reservation in the private sector. ""If the coalition of the BSP, JCC-J and CPI comes to power in Chhattisgarh, it will do its best to ensure that Adivasis, Dalits, backwards, minorities, labourers and farmers get their rights. ""Uplift of the poor, farmers, labourers, tribals and Dalits is only possible in the state when this alliance comes to power. They will be able to lead a life with respect and dignity, besides Naxalism will also be contained,"" Mayawati said.

However, many of the city’s intellectual elite who had received invitations to the programme from the saffron party refused to attend Shah’s lecture. The event in memory of Chatterjee – who wrote India’s national song, the  was organised by the Syama Prasad Mookerjee Research Foundation, a Delhi-based think tank associated with the BJP.   reported that while eminent Kolkatans such as movie actor Soumitra Chatterjee, former Supreme Court judge Ashok Ganguly, writer Santosh Rana, theatre actors Rudraprasad Sengupta, Chandan Sen and Manoj Mitra, singer Amar Paul and painter Samir Aich had received invitations from the BJP, they all turned it down. Soumitra Chatterjee reportedly rejected the invitation with a specific complaint against “demonetisation and the party’s politics of targeting communities”. In the end, Bengali-language writer Buddhadeb Guha was the only prominent intellectual to attend the programme, with BJP workers filling up the auditorium that has a capacity to seat 600. Union minister and BJP leader from West Bengal Babul Supriyo blamed the ruling Trinamool Congress for the guests’ no-show. “Bengal is a state where intellectuals are threatened even if they vote against the ruling party,” Supriyo told  . “How can they attend meetings? There are many intellectuals who support us and have connected over phone, but may not always turn up in person.”  Shah’s speech focussed on ideas of nationalism and in line with this, the event kicked off with a homage to Mother India in the form of an image created by Bengali painter Abanindranath Tagore in 1905. “The Congress’ appeasement resulted in Partition,” Shah said, referring to the decision to retain only two stanzas of the   following complaints by many Muslims.

He took a dig at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's proposal of putting up a ""one-to-one"" fight against the BJP and said the Congress did not need any advice from her. Chowdhury claimed that Banerjee was trying to project herself as a pan-India leader. ""She is advising the Congress on what to do and what not to…. Who has appointed her as an adviser to the Congress? If you are serious about fighting the communal forces, you have to fight under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,"" he said. Banerjee, during her recent visit to New Delhi, had talked about a ""one-to-one fight"" between the BJP and the opposition parties in every state. Chowdhury also blamed Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal for failing to control violence in the state during Ram Navami celebrations. ""The state government was unable to tackle the clashes as the TMC and the BJP are two sides of the same coin,"" he said. The Congress did not need any suggestion from the TMC on how to deal with communal forces, Chowdhury added.

" The indication of a changing political narrative in West Bengal, following an unprecedented surge in BJP's vote share in Sabang assembly bypoll, has forced the ruling TMC and the Congress to look for ""traitors"" within their parties. Leaders of both political parties feel that defections played a role in the Sabang poll results in which Trinamool bagged 1,06,179 votes and the BJP secured 37,476 voters, up from 5,610 votes in the 2016 assembly polls. The district Congress leadership feels that defection of Manas Bhunia to the TMC to become its Rajya Sabha member has dealt a huge blow to his party in Sabang. ""Some of our own has betrayed us. Both the TMC and the BJP have taken advantage of this situation,"" said a district Congress leader. The bypoll was won by Gita Rani Bhunia, the wife of Manas Bhunia. A section of West Midnapore district TMC leadership feels that former TMC leader Mukul Roy, who recently joined the BJP,played a crucial role in increasing the saffron party's ballot share. Roy, who was once a second-in-command in the TMC, knows the district and its leadership like the back of his hand. There are several leaders who were handpicked by Roy during the initial days of the TMC. ""There are a lot of people in the districts who owe a lot to Roy for their political careers. We have to find out whether they have betrayed us or not,"" said a district TMC leader. The apprehension of the district TMC leader was endorsed by another senior party member and state transport minister Suvendu Adhikari. ""Before the Sabang bypoll, a plot was hatched by an expelled party leader. He had got hold of phone numbers of our leaders and found ways to intimidate them. The party supremo has found out who gave out these numbers. That person has been sent packing."" Adhikari said. The BJP came third in the Sabang election but the big leap in its vote share raised several eyebrows in political circles of Bengal which is preparing for the upcoming panchayat polls. In several booths of the assembly constituency, where the TMC has been ruling the roost, the BJP has seen an eight to 10 times rise in its vote share. The West Midnapore district leadership of the Trinamool Congress also expressed concern over the rise in BJP's vote share. ""Something is wrong somewhere. The fact that the BJP has seen a 15 percent rise in its vote share despite not having an organisational base in the area proves that a few people have betrayed us,"" another senior leader of the district unit of the TMC told   on the condition of anonymity. TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee, however, said his party was not bothered about who came second or third in the election as the TMC bagged 51 percent of the total votes polled. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh, who is elated over his party's performance in the bypoll, said a there is a political undercurrent in favour of the BJP in the state. ""From the BJP's performance in Sabang, you can understand what is going to happen in the next Lok Sabha polls. The support base of the BJP is growing every day, people are just looking for an opportunity to vote for us,"" he said. In the Sabang bypoll, the CPM in second with 41,987 votes.

Karnataka, under Siddaramaiah, is following West Bengal and Kerala models for committing political murders,"" it said. The team also alleged that never in the state's history had a state minister (KJ George) been charged as the first accused in a case related to the death of a senior police official. The CBI had in October last year named George as an accused in an FIR filed in connection with the alleged suicide of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) MK Ganapathy. The BJP social media team also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi – during his 4 February 4 public rally in Bengaluru– had rightly pointed out the ""ease of doing murder"" in Karnataka. The team also hit out at Siddaramaiah for claiming that Karnataka's crime rate was lower than that of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It is wrong to compare a progressive state like Karnataka to Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, which are facing different problems due to a high density of population. ""This is an insult to Kannadigas"", it said. Countering the chief minister's barb that Modi had no right to speak about corruption especially when the BJP's state chief BS Yeddyurappa had gone to jail on graft charges, it claimed there were over 67 cases pending against Siddaramaiah in the Lokayukta and the Anti-Corruption Bureau.

Reacting to Siddaramaiah's comment that the Modi government has not waived farmer loans, the party's digital team alleged that as many 3,500 farmers have committed suicides in the state under his government. The team also said that the chief minister conveniently forgets to mention the waiving of loans to the tune of Rs 36,000 crore and Rs 30,000 crore by the Uttar Pradesh and the Maharashtra governments, respectively. On Siddaramaiah's claim that his government had built the world's largest solar plant in Karnataka, the BJP said only about 400 MW is operational out of the 2,000 MW.

" With the BJP set to emerge as the single largest party in Karnataka, its leaders described Tuesday's Assembly poll results as an endorsement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development agenda and claimed that the people had rejected the divisive, toxic and negative politics of the Congress. According to Election Commission (EC) figures at 3 pm, the BJP had won 57 seats and was leading in 47 segments, well on course to emerge as the single largest party in the southern state. The ruling Congress had won 29 seats and was leading in 49 constituencies. Buoyed by the emerging picture, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad took a swipe at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, saying someone was dreaming of becoming the prime minister, a reference to Gandhi's statement during the Karnataka poll campaign that he was ready for the top post if his party won the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Prasad's cabinet colleague, Nirmala Sitharaman, said it was a historic day for the BJP and the results were an endorsement of Modi's development agenda. The people had rejected the divisive, toxic and negative politics of the Congress, she added. Another Union minister, Nitin Gadkari, hailed the BJP's performance in the southern state and said the results and trends available till now virtually proved that the saffron party's ""Congress-free India"" slogan was turning out to be true. ""We had been talking about a Congress-free India. The Karnataka poll results are virtually proving that. The Congress is not in power in any of the key states, barring Punjab. The condition of the Congress is such that it is opposing (the BJP) for the sake of opposing,"" he added. Stating that the poll results underlined the faith of the people in Modi's leadership and the BJP's ideology, Prasad exuded confidence that the party would retain power at the Centre after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Prakash Javadekar, another Union minister who was also the BJP in-charge for the Karnataka election, said the saffron party performed better than the Congress as it was a party of the masses, while the latter was a party of dynasts. ""This is a victory of Modi and party president Amit Shah's strategy,"" he added. Polling for the 222 of the 224 Assembly seats in Karnataka was held on 12 May.

"Congress president Rahul Gandhi started the second day of his Karnataka visit on Wednesday. On his itinerary are meetings with Congress leaders, visit to temples, interactions with students and public meetings. He visited the Shringeri Sharadamba Temple in Chikkamagaluru along with other Congress leaders. Gandhi is on a two-day visit to poll-bound Karnataka, the third in over a month. His complete schedule is as follows: 8.30 am: Meeting with Block Congress presidents, Dakshina Kannada & Udupi 9.30 am: Meeting with senior leaders of Dakshina Kannada & Udupi 11.20 am: Visit to Sharadamba Temple, Sringeri Mutt 12.25 pm: Interaction with students of Rajiv Gandhi Sanskrit University, Sringeri Mutt 3 pm: Public meeting at Chikkamagaluru 6 pm: Public meeting at Hassan  On Tuesday, Gandhi had said the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi were ""not inclusive"" as he ignored farmers but waived off loans of big industrialists. ""Modi speaks about Basavanna but his policies are not inclusive. If he can waive off Rs 25 lakh crore worth loans of big industrialists, why can't he help farmers?"" he asked at a public rally in Karnataka's coastal Udupi district. He told the gathering that though farmers had pleaded for the right Minimum Support Price for their produce, it was not fulfilled. ""In contrast, our government in the state has spent thrice the amount on irrigation projects than the Modi government did for the entire nation. We do not spread hatred, we abide by the principles of Basavanna,"" he said a day after the state cabinet agreed to grant status of religious minority to Lingayats and Veerashaivas, who are followers of Basavanna. Observing that the motto of his party's government in the state was Basavanna's principle of ""follow what you preach"", Gandhi said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah took the lead in waiving farmers' loans. He also lauded the state's youth for the IT revolution they spearheaded in Karnataka. Addressing another rally in the port city of Mangaluru, Gandhi said as Modi had only one more year left, he should work towards generating employment to fulfil at least his promise of providing 2 crore jobs during his tenure. The party chief also accused the prime minster of ""helping his industrial friends"" in converting their black money during the 50-day note ban period from 10 November to 31 December, 2016, while ""the common people had to stand in queues to exchange their hard-earned money"". Stressing that the country doesn't run on false promises and speeches, he said: ""This (upcoming Karnataka assembly) election will be run by candidates who have worked hard for the people and the party.

Addressing people outside his residence in Poes Garden, Rajinikanth said that it would be an ‘embarrassment to enjoy the IPL at such a crucial time’. Also asking the team owners and players to support the state’s cause for the larger benefit of the farmers, Rajinikanth said: Rajinikanth has joined several other leaders in the state in their demand for the formation of the Cauvery Management Board.

": With the Ram Mandir movement gathering momentum, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said no Hindu text condones the use of violence to get one's way and scriptures say people should build Ram in their hearts. ""In fact, if anything, there is a scripture that says build Ram in your heart. And if Ram is built in our heart it should little matter where else he is or he is not, because he is everywhere,"" Tharoor said in an exclusive interview to  . The Congress MP was responding to a question about his recent remark that no good Hindu would want a temple at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. Tharoor reiterated his point asking if a good Hindu would want to build a Ram Temple at the expense of an act of violence. ""My only point is, would a Hindu have wanted to build such a precious place at the expense of conducting an act of violence. A good Hindu is a law-abiding Hindu. A good Hindu is someone who has  ,"" the Congress leader asked. He went on to argue that while a good Hindu was also obviously somebody who worshipped and believed in his worship, Hindu scriptures do not allow the use of violence to have one's way. ""A good Hindu is also obviously somebody who worships and believes in his worship. But where have we been told in our Hindu texts and our Hindu teachings which, in fact since the days of Adi Shankaracharya, have emphasized much more on  . Where have we been told that we should conduct violence against other people to have our way,"" questioned Tharoor. The Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram also wondered what about his remarks had ""shocked the BJP so much"". He said, ""Most good Hindus I know would want a Ram Temple at the place where they believe he was born. But most good Hindus would not have wanted it by demolishing other people's place of worship. And this is more or less what Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani also said."" The Congress leader quoted Advani as having called the day of demolition of Babri Masjid as the ""saddest day of his life"". ""Advani said he would have respectfully wanted to relocate the site and Vajpayee had also hinted at all sorts of compromises provided the Ram Temple could also be built, it could even be a joint wall between a mosque and a temple. Who knows what Vajpayee would have wanted? He is not here to tell us but no, neither of them ever spoke in terms of demolishing the mosque and when it happened they both condemned it. So what am I saying that is so shocking for the BJP?"" asked Tharoor. On the perception that majority Hindus want a Ram Temple at the site where evidence also suggests that a temple existed, Tharoor said this was an academic argument. ""A temple really did exist. Whether it was the Ram Temple we don't know. Definitely there were pillars underneath. But given the experiences of that period so many temples were destroyed and mosques built in their places. I am not challenging the historical veracity of this belief, that debate is over. That's totally academic now,"" said the Congress MP. The Congress leader acknowledged that ""the important thing is that an overwhelming majority of Hindus particularly in north India believe this was where Lord Ram was born and where there should be a  "", but went on to add, ""to my mind arguing that point is academic."" He then asked if a Hindu would ever want to build such a precious place, a temple, at the expense of conducting an act of violence.

"Making it clear that water cannot be released from the Mettur dam on the customary date of 12 June owing to poor storage, the state government unveiled in the Assembly on Friday, a Rs 115 crore   crop package for the benefit of farmers. The government reiterated that it had been strongly urging the Centre to set up the Cauvery Water Management Authority and the Cauvery Water Regulatory Committee at the earliest. During Zero Hour in the House, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, in a   statement, said the storage in the Mettur dam stood at 39.42 feet, and hence, the release of water on the customary date of 12 June would not be possible. “I am happy to announce the   package, which would help farmers cultivate short-term paddy and other crops,” Palaniswami said. (Source:  ) The DMK on Friday led a walkout by Opposition parties from the Assembly, in protest against the statement of Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami that the release of water from the Mettur dam on 12 June would not be possible this year. However, the CM hit back at the principal Opposition party, pointing out that water had never been released from the Mettur dam on the customary date when the DMK was in power. While announcing the   package in the House, Palaniswami said poor storage at the Mettur dam meant water would not be released on the customary date. In response, the DMK, led by party working president MK Stalin, staged a walkout. Its allies – the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League – followed suit.  In his defence, Palaniswami listed the dates on which water was released from the Mettur dam during the DMK’s regimes since the 1980s, and pointed out: “So, it is clear that there is no history of water [having been] released on the said date whenever the DMK was in power.

" The Supreme Court today directed the Jammu and Kashmir government to file its response on a plea alleging custodial torture of the Kathua case witness by August 27. A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud fixed the matter for further hearing in August 29. The top court was hearing a plea by Talib Hussain, a key witness in the Kathua gang rape-and-murder case, alleging custodial torture by the state police in an alleged rape case lodged against him by his sister-in-law. The court had earlier asked the lawyer, appearing for Hussain’s cousin Mumtaz Ahmed Khan, to satisfy it on how a writ of habeas corpus (produce the body) was maintainable in the present case where the accused was in lawful police custody following an FIR being registered against him. The counsel had referred to a Supreme Court judgement and said irrespective of the nature of detention, whether legal or illegal, such a petition could always be filed in cases of custodial torture. The petition was opposed by the lawyer, appearing for Hussain’s sister-in-law who has filed the FIR alleging rape, that there were as many as 10 FIRs against the accused and no relief should be granted without hearing the victim. The plea seeks protection of Hussain in police custody and alleges that he had been brutally beaten up in the alleged fake rape case. Hussain is a key witness in the Kathua case, in which an eight-year-old girl from a minority nomadic community was abducted in January and gang-raped before being killed.

"The Bombay High Court on Friday, 25 May, said it cannot allow homoeopathy student Fakeha Badami to appear for her first year repeat examinations as she was held ineligible by the college because of poor attendance. The college's lawyer, Sahil Salvi, refuted the allegations and said Badami, a resident of suburban Bandra, was held ineligible as she had low attendance. ""The college is willing to let her appear for the second repeat exams, scheduled to be held in December this year, provided she attends all the repeat lectures that will be conducted till November,"" Salvi told a vacation bench of justices S J Kathawalla and A S Gadkari on Friday. The court accepted this statement and said, ""We hope after she attends the repeat lectures and appears for the exams the college allows her to attend the regular lectures and not disallow her then saying she is wearing hijab"". To this, Salvi said the hijab was never an issue and that all students were allowed to wear the same and attend college. The court said the petitioner also should accept the college's statement. As per her petition, Badami had in 2016 enrolled in the Bachelor of Homoeopathic Medicine and Surgery course in the college, which was affiliated to the Maharashtra University of Health Services (MUHS). The petition claimed that she and several other students who wore hijab were prohibited from entering the college premises. Badami then wrote letters to the MUHS and the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) which asked the college to resolve the issue, saying it cannot compel a student to not wear the hijab. But, the college did not budge, said the petition. The student had first approached the high court in November 2017 when she was not allowed to appear for the examinations held then. The college had then told the high court that it would accommodate her in the repeat lectures and examinations to be held in the 2018 summer, it said. Despite this, she was allowed to attend the repeat lectures only from March this year and was again barred from appearing for the repeat exams on the ground of poor attendance, Badami claimed in the petition. The other Muslim students had either stopped wearing the hijab to the college or had left the institution, but since she continued to wear the hijab, she was being harassed, the student alleged.

": The ruling Congress in Mizoram on Wednesday urged people of the Christian-dominated state to support the party in the assembly election next month, alleging that the entry of BJP might hurt their religious freedom. Countering the charge, the BJP said it was a propaganda of the Congress to tarnish the image of the party. ""The Congress should win with a comfortable margin as a fractured mandate would pave way for the BJP to go for a post-poll alliance with the Mizo National Front (MNF),"" state Congress spokesperson Lallianchhunga said. ""The BJP can cause damage to the soul, spirit and body of the Christians in Mizoram,"" Lallianchhunga, also the party's media cell chairperson, said in a statement. People should support the Congress, church leaders and civil societies in protecting the state from such dangers and for protecting religious freedom, he said. Mizoram is the only state in the northeastern region under the Congress which is in power since 2008. The election to the 40-member state assembly will be held on November 28. Rev LR Colney, one of the two Christian priests to contest the polls on a BJP ticket, said the party was not a religious group but a political party. Branding the BJP as ""anti-Christian"" and ""pro-Hindu"" was baseless as it has never been proved, he said, adding that it is a propaganda of the Congress to tarnish its image. Persecution of Christians has occurred in many places during the regimes of the Congress, Janata Dal and the BJP, Colney said. In a recent news report, Tripura BJP general secretary Pratima Bhowmik had indicated that in a fractured post-poll scenario, the opposition MNF might form a coalition with the BJP to form government in Mizoram. The MNF, however, has maintained that it would not form an alliance with the BJP or any other party in the upcoming election. ""The MNF leadership cannot afford to be seen as being close to the saffron party as the BJP has been a political pariah in the state,"" Lallianchhunga said. But the post-poll scenario could be different as the MNF would not hesitate to overrule public opinion after the poll process, he claimed.

"Pakistan’s military is using fear and intimidation to undermine press freedom even though violence against reporters has decreased, the   said on Wednesday. “The military bars access to certain areas, uses direct and indirect acts of intimidation, and even allegedly instigates violence against reporters to prevent critical reporting,” the non-profit organisation  . “Freelancers and journalists from established media companies said that to avoid retaliation, they often tone down or avoid controversial but newsworthy stories.” In April, Geo TV, one of Pakistan’s major television networks, reportedly went   in most parts of the country. The network’s channels were reportedly disrupted in the first week of March in cantonment areas across the country and residential neighbourhoods controlled by the military. Cable operators in other areas then started blocking the channels. The news channel may have also irked the military by its critical coverage of Pakistan’s placement on a terror financing  , and its criticism of Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s positions on domestic and foreign policy matters. A month later, the distribution of Pakistan’s oldest newspaper   was   after it published an interview with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who has accused the military and the judiciary of working together to remove him and implicating him in corruption cases. In June, journalist Gul Bukhari, who is a vocal critic of the Army was   for a few hours in Lahore’s cantonment area.    The Committee to Protect Journalists said senior editors and journalists had confided in private that “conditions for the free press are as bad as when the country was under military dictatorship, and journalists were flogged and newspapers forced to close”. “The military has quietly, but effectively, set restrictions on reporting: from barring access to regions including Balochistan where there is armed separatism and religious extremism, to encouraging self-censorship through direct and indirect methods of intimidation,” the organisation said. Military officials allegedly call editors to complain about coverage and even allegedly instigate violence against reporters.   “While the decline in the killing of journalists is encouraging, the government needs to counteract pressures that have resulted in rampant self-censorship and threats to the media,” said CPJ Asia Program Coordinator Steven Butler. “Pakistan must address the disturbing trend of impunity and attacks on journalists to shore up this faltering pillar of democracy.”    The non-profit organisation has asked the Pakistan government, among other things, to expedite the revision and enactment of a draft journalist safety legislation, which includes provisions for a special prosecutor to pursue crimes against press freedom. The organisation has also urged the government to ensure that the law creates a legal and regulatory framework that allows investigators to pursue people responsible for committing crimes against journalists, “even when state-related actors may be involved, including those in the military or intelligence”.",Scroll Staff,PTI

"The Election Commission on Tuesday issued a showcause notice to the Aam Aadmi Party, asking it to explain alleged discrepancies in the donations it received in the 2014-’15 financial year,   reported. The poll panel asked the party to explain within 20 days why no action should be taken against it. The Election Commission said that hawala transactions had been “wrongly disclosed as voluntary donations”, PTI reported.   In January, the Central Board of Direct Taxes   to the Election Commission the alleged discrepancies in the party’s actual and reported donations. An assessment of the party’s finances showed that it had contravened the provisions of Section 29(C) of the Representation of the People Act of 1951, the tax body claimed. The provision mandates all political parties to inform tax authorities of details of donations of more than Rs 20,000. Parties found violating this provision are barred from receiving any tax relief.

Congress general-secretary Avinash Pande said unemployment has increased during the BJP rule. The party cited labour bureau statistics in the booklet to say that the BJP-led Union government created only 4.16 lakh jobs in 2016-17 against Modi's promise of creating 2 crore jobs per year.

" The West Bengal panchayat polls have not only kicked off a political battle but also infighting within families at many places where relatives are pitted against each other in an intense contest. The three-tier polls, spread across over 58,000 seats scheduled for Monday, have several instances where a father is pitted against his son, a mother is being challenged by her daughter, a son-in-law is taking on his father-in-law and a brother is slugging it out in the poll battlefield against his sister. Prominent parties including the TMC, the BJP and the Left have obliged competing relatives by fielding them on their symbol to capitalise on the family popularity in the respective areas. For instance, in Alipurduar district, a retired school teacher Bhognarayan Das is contesting on a TMC ticket against his son Amal, who is a BJP candidate. Das, 68, had asked his son to refrain from contesting the polls as it might cause animosity within the family, but he refused to withdraw. ""I had told my father that politics is all about political belief and ideology. And our political battle won't cause any harm to our relations,"" Amal said. In North 24 Parganas district's Jagulia gram panchayat, two daughters-in-law of the same family are contesting each other. While Rima Das is in the field on a TMC ticket, her elder sister-in-law Bulbul Das is contesting as an Independent candidate. However, the two are of the opinion that politics did not create a rift in their family as ""politics has nothing to do with personal relationships"". In Nadia, Taldaha-Majhdia gram panchayat, three members of the same family are pitted against each other but poll rivalry has not soured their bonding. Bablu Roy, the sitting TMC candidate, is fighting against his sister-in-law Aduri Roy, who is a BJP candidate, while his uncle Laxman Roy is fighting as an Independent with support from the Left Front. ""Whoever wins the poll will be from our family and will work for the development of our village and the two defeated will support him or her,"" Bablu told  . The three, who are part of a 10-member strong joint family, make it a point to have their lunch and dinner with other family members after a day's campaign, just as it used to be earlier. There are also examples of family rivalry where relatives are taking on each other in the polls to settle score. Partha Pratim Das, a TMC Zilla Parishad candidate from East Midnapore district, is miffed that his wife Lipika contesting on a BJP ticket in a nearby seat.  Lipika, on the other hand, said she wanted to teach her husband a lesson as her pleas to shun politics for several years have fallen on deaf ears. ""We are living separately for the past few years,"" Das said. In Alipurduar district, two sisters-in-law — Tushi Roy Sarkar and Aripta Roy Sarkar — are fighting from Chaporerpar gram panchayat seats with Tushi as a TMC candidate and Arpita as Independent nominee. According to their father-in-law Dhananjay Roy Sarkar, a TMC loyalist in Alipurduar district, Arpita is contesting as an Independent as she was denied a ticket despite being an old timer. According to political leaders of various parties, rural polls in West Bengal, since its beginning in 1978, has witnessed a peculiar trend where family rivalry results in kin contesting against each other either on a party ticket or as Independents. ""Although there are cases of bonhomie between family members fighting against each other, in most cases family rivalry comes into politics where there is a competition to outdo each other in electoral battle,"" CPM central committee member Sujan Chakraborty told  . Senior TMC leader Nirmal Ghosh also agreed with his views but added there were instances where political rivalry also divided a family. ""When you are in a political battle, it hardly matters what is your relation with your opponent. What matters is victory and this leads to the political fight entering into a family,"" Ghosh told  . State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said as the elections were held across thousands of seats, in most cases political parties had no other choice but to give tickets to members of the same family. According to West Bengal State Election Commission sources, of the 48,650 seats in 3,358 gram panchayats, 16,814 were uncontested and of the 9,217 seats in 341 panchayat samitis, 3,059 were uncontested. In the 20 zilla parishads, 203 of the 825 seats were uncontested. They said Monday's elections will be held in 621 zilla parishads and 6,157 panchayat samitis, besides 31,827 gram panchayats.",PTI,FP Staff

" Former Goa RSS chief Subhash Velingkar claimed even Lord Ram would have to spend money to get elected in the current political situation. He was addressing a youth convention of the Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM), which he mentors in Panaji, on Wednesday. ""During elections, politicians are busy luring two kinds of people, the youth and women, whom they find gullible, by offering them cash or gifts,"" he said. ""Due to rampant use of money power during elections, in the current situation, even Shri Ram will not get elected if he doesn't spend money."" He had floated the GSM on the eve of the 2017 Goa Assembly elections after he fell out with BJP leader Manohar Parrikar over the issue of medium of instruction in school education. He had accused the BJP of ""losing morality and indulging in the same practices like other parties in the country"". Velingkar also attacked the chief minister over his decision to drop two ailing ministers from the state Cabinet. ""Parrikar dropped two ministers from the Cabinet because they are sick, but he himself remains stuck to his position despite being critically ill,"" he said. Parrikar is currently admitted to AIIMS in Delhi for a pancreatic ailment. The former Goa RSS chief also attacked politicians for frequenting hospitals in the US even for a minor cause at the cost of the state exchequer. ""The situation is not right in Goa. Politicians go to the US for treatment, but we have to get treated at the state-run Goa Medical College and Hospital. They can remove others from the Cabinet claiming that they are ailing, but when he (Parrikar) is critically ill, he retains his own position,"" said Velingkar. Velingkar, who was a political mentor of Parrikar and AYUSH Minister Shripad Naik in their initial days, said the two had to fight money power when they entered politics. ""It was difficult to build the party without money, and it took ten years for us to do so. People had got a habit of accepting money,"" he said. ""We could not get a candidate to contest the election from Panaji. That is when we decided to field Manohar Parrikar, who was new graduate from IIT and running his factory."" He claimed Parrikar had spent Rs 26,000 for his first election, which he won, while his rivals had spent Rs 50 lakh.

"Congress president Rahul Gandhi will on Monday launch his party's campaign in the poll bound Madhya Pradesh, known to be a BJP bastion, from Bhopal, where posters have come up describing him as a devotee of Lord Shiva. He will take part in a roadshow and also address party workers during his day-long visit to the state capital. Rahul will arrive by aircraft at around noon on Monday. He will then embark on a 15-kilometer-long roadshow from Lalghati Chowk, located close to the airport, after seeking the blessings of more than 11 Hindu priests, state party spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi told   on Sunday. Rahul's roadshow, in which he will ride an open vehicle, will conclude at Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd's Dussehra Maidan, where he will interact with party cadres, he added. ""A T-shape ramp has been constructed near the stage from where Rahul is going to take questions from party workers and interact with them,"" Chaturvedi said. Besides, he is going to address a meeting of Congress workers, which is open to public, before leaving in the evening, he added. ""We are upbeat as our leader is coming to launch the election campaign,"" Chaturvedi said. Ahead of the visit, the main Opposition party has put up posters and banners in Bhopal describing the 48-year-old Congress chief, who just returned from a pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar, as a 'Shiv bhakt'. As part of the pilgrimage, devotees undertake an arduous journey to Mount Kailash, which is considered the abode of Lord Shiva in Hindu mythology.

": The BJP on Saturday dismissed the Congress' ""conflict of interests"" accusation against Union minister Piyush Goyal as a ""political hit job"" based on baseless and malicious charges and claimed that it has become the opposition party's modus operandi to gain ""cheap publicity"" with its incorrect allegations. Coming out in strong defence of the railway minister, the BJP said facts show absolutely no wrongdoing or irregularity as he stopped all business activities and resigned from all directorships after he became a minister. ""The falsehoods spread by the Congress reflect their desperation since they have nothing to attack the Modi government by. The facts expose it for blatant misrepresentations using falsehoods and malicious propaganda against Piyush Goyal who is an eminent chartered and was carrying out his professional work through his companies,"" its statement said. The BJP said the date cited by the Congress of the sale of a firm, Flashnet, in which Goyal had ownership, was also incorrect as it took place in July 2014 before the declaration of assets and liabilities by the ministers in the Modi government was submitted on 25 July, 2014 and not on 29 September, as alleged by the opposition party. ""This sale was made at full market value as per third party, independent, expert valuation and the entire sale value was received in the bank before submitting the declaration and was fully reflected in the value of assets submitted,"" it said. ""It seems that Piyush Goyal who had a successful investment banking career before he became a minister, is being targeted, because perhaps the Congress wishes to divert attention from the series of scandals of its leaders for which they have no answers. Is esorting to manufacturing controversies using malicious falsehoods which are completely baseless,"" the BJP claimed. Accusing Goyal of ""impropriety"" and ""conflict of interest"", the Congress said that four months after holding the portfolio of New and Renewable Energy, Goyal sold his entire holding in Flashnet Info Solutions (India) Limited, owned by him and his wife at 1000 percent premium to a company of Piramal group which has interests in the renewable energy sector.

" Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyalu has questioned the manner in which the Chief Information Commissioner RK Mathur dissolved and reconstituted a bench hearing complaints against political parties, saying the move erodes the independence of individual information commissioners. ""It also raises serious questions about the independence of individual information commissioner, who can be part of a bench for some time and not for some other, against his will, without his consent and without a reason or without giving a reason. Can a larger bench be constituted without reference from the existing bench?,"" Acharyalu asked in scathing letter dated 22 February, 2018 to Mathur, accessed by the  . The letter circulated among all information commissioners in a recent meeting was a follow-up of a 7 February letter which also raised question marks on the manner in which bench of Sridhar Acharyulu, Sudhir Bhargava and Bimal Julka hearing complaints against six political parties was dissolved by Mathur. The political parties — BJP, Congress, BSP, NCP, CPI and CPM — were brought under the ambit of the RTI by a full bench of the Commission in 2013 but it is alleged they were not following the directives resulting in complaints filed before the Commission. For six months in 2016, the bench had heard the case but in December that year, Julka recused himself citing his pending work. After this, a new bench was constituted by Chief Information Commissioner RK Mathur in August 2017 in which none of the members of the previous bench was included. Interestingly in January 2017, Acharyulu was divested of hearing RTI matters of Human Resource Development Ministry, days after his order calling for disclosure of academic records of the Delhi University for the year in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi also passed out became public. Just 10 days before that he was assigned the ministry. ""Distribution and redistribution of subjects cannot be left to any single individual authority but to be decided by Commission as such in a reasonable manner,"" he says in the letter. He said there should be a system and guidelines so that it becomes impossible to bring ""external pressures"" to change the subject of particular commission or remove one commissioner from a Bench. The hearings in political parties' matter have not taken place since a new four-member bench was constituted in August 2017 despite a Delhi High Court order to complete the case in a fixed time-limit. The four-member bench has also been reconstituted now after one of the members retired in January this year. ""After dozens of specific complaints, we are consuming years in the process. What kind of message we are sending across the nation? Why are we not discussing these issues in the CIC meetings?"" Acharyulu said as he asked for a transparent, independent and deliberated decisions on the ""critical issue of political parties"" saying failing to do so will ""seriously affect"" its credibility. ""If we cannot do this, cannot act independently, cannot protect the individual independence of information commissioners, we cannot still claim to be an institution of accountability and transparency. ""In such an event of a disaster, should this institution continue without a purpose as a burden on the people's exchequer, and wait for people to demand scrapping of? Please think over,"" he said. Acharyalu said it was not just for the commissioner who was removed, but the entire CIC should know the fact of removal and reasons for it. He has demanded his letters dated 7 February and 21 February 2018 — addressed to Mathur and circulated among all information commissioners — be posted on the commission's website. ""As this issue is of high public interest, and because the people have right to information from political parties, these aspects must be deliberated and placed in public domain,"" he said.",PTI,PTI
" Attacking Delhi government's bureaucrats, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday alleged that some officers were in a ""deep nexus"" with ration mafia, while his deputy Manish Sisodia wondered why Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal was ""protecting"" black marketeers. The accusations came after the AAP government postponed a cabinet meeting, where, Sisodia said, Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash ""failed"" to bring a note on its ambitious doorstep delivery of ration proposal. Both Kejriwal and Sisodia's remarks came at a time when the AAP dispensation and the bureaucrats have been at loggerheads since the alleged assault on Prakash by some Aam Aadmi Party MLAs at the chief minister's residence on 19 February. ""Nexus between some bureaucrats n ration mafia is very deep. Many politicians from opposition parties are beneficiaries thro these bureaucrats. That's the reason for stiff resistance to doorstep delivery of rations (sic),"" Kejriwal tweeted. He, however, said his government was committed to ""root out corruption"" in the public distribution system and implement doorstep delivery of rations despite resistance from bureaucracy and opposition parties. Addressing a press conference, Sisodia, flanked by Food & Civil Supplies Minister Imran Hussain, demanded a probe into the alleged nexus between officers and ration mafia. Miffed at the chief secretary, Sisodia said Prakash was asked to bring a proposal to the cabinet meeting on 27 February, but he did not do so and he again ""failed"" to bring the same to today's cabinet meeting as well. He alleged that senior officers were trying to stop the government's efforts to introduce doorstep delivery of ration and questioned why Prakash has sent the food commissioner on leave despite the fact that people were facing problems. ""The LG had told us that no senior rank officer will go on leave without permission from the concerned minister and the chief minister, but the chief secretary has sent food commissioner on leave, which indicates some officers are working under the pressure of ration mafia. ""I ask the LG why he wants to protect ration mafia in Delhi. We know that previous Congress government had supported ration mafia and senior BJP leaders have also many ration shops..."" he said. Sisodia said Chief Minister Kejriwal has directed Prakash to come out with a note on the doorstep delivery of ration to the next cabinet meeting on 6 March.

" A combative Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging he gave ""brooms to the poor"" in the name of the Swachh Bharat Mission while allowing his industrialist ""friends to clean money from the banks"". Rahul also levelled a slew of allegations at the BJP-led Centre, claiming it failed to provide relief to debt-saddled farmers while wreaking havoc on the economy with his demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) moves. He accused the prime minister of insulting the people by belittling what the country had achieved in the last 70 years. The Congress president began a roadshow from eastern Rajasthan's Dholpur district, considered the home turf of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, aiming to boost his party's prospects in the assembly elections slated for 7 December. Beginning the roadshow in Mania town, which shares borders with Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, he levelled allegations against the government on a range of issues ranging from the Rafale deal, law and order, and even the attack on people from other states in Gujarat. The Congress chief said it was not a party or a person but the people who by the dint of their hard work made India stand up after Independence. ""They were your parents and grandparents who put in efforts to make India stand but Prime Minister Narendra Modi says that nothing was done in the last 70 years. He says everything happened only after he came to power. How arrogant this person is,"" charged Rahul at a public meeting in Bayana town of Bharatpur during his 150-kilometre long roadshow. The Congress chief, in his public meetings during the roadshow, also said while Modi gave ""brooms to the poor and asked them to clean India under Swacch Bharat Abhiyan and at the same time, he asked top 15-20 industrialists to clean money from banks"". Attacking the Centre's economic and agricultural policies, he said, ""Not a single rupee of farmers' loans was waived by the Modi government"" and the Make In India campaign had ""failed"" with even phones and T-shirts being outsourced from China. The Congress wants phones to be made in India with the tag of 'Made in Dholpur,' he said. Rahul said the prime minister during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls had said he wanted to be a 'chowkidar' but never clarified for whom.  ""Now people are laughing. He never told that whose chowkidar he wanted to be. They got to know later that Anil Ambani is being protected,"" he alleged. Ambani-led Reliance Group has already rejected Congress' allegations. In Rajasthan, Rahul alleged that Modi benefitted 15-20 top industrialists of the country instead of the farmers. The Congress president reiterated his allegation on the Rafale deal that the Hindustan Aeronautical Limited was ignored and an ""industrialist friend"" benefitted from the deal which he claimed was finalised at higher prices compared to rates decided by the former UPA government. He also alleged that people like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Lalit Modi, Vijay Mallya had benefitted under the present dispensation. Rahul claimed that Vijay Mallya had alleged he had met Union minister Arun Jaitley before leaving the country. Significantly, Jaitley has rubbished any charges of impropriety. He claimed the former UPA government waived off farmers' loans worth Rs 70,000 crore but even as bad debt worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore were written off by the present government, not even Rs 1 of farmers was waived. ""Former UPA government gave MGNREGA, brought a tribal bill, rights of food and information, meal to students in schools, waived off farmers' loan worth Rs 70,000 crore. In Rajasthan, the Ashok Gehlot government introduced free medicine schemes but what Narendra Modi and Vasundhara Raje governments did for the poor?” he asked. I went to the prime minister's office only once and that too to raise farmers' issues but Modi remained silent and did not utter a single word, he claimed. ""Demonetisation and GST have finished the country's economy,"" he said continuing the attack. Referring to law and order issues, he alleged, ""A BJP MLA allegedly raped a woman in UP but the prime minister did not utter a word. They say Beti Bachao, they have forgotten Beti Padhao...BJP se Bachao (save from the BJP),"" he said taking a jibe. Targeting Vasundhara Raje, the Congress president alleged that Lalit Modi gave money directly to Raje's son.  However, he did not specify when and why Lalit Modi allegedly paid Raje's son Dushyant Singh. On the attack on migrants in Gujarat, he said youths from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were being attacked and forced to leave. ""Youth trusted Modi but Modi betrayed their trust,"" he charged. Rahul exuded confidence that the Congress would win the assembly elections in Rajasthan. He said the Congress government in the state will work as per people's 'Mann ki Baat'. He also urged people to form a Congress government at the Centre which would work for the poor, farmers and youths. He said people should try making RSS and BJP understand that there is no benefit in ""dividing"" the country.

"Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has said development is the weapon being used against Naxalites, with the government providing villagers in the rebel-hit remote forests of Bastar with roads and electricity. The chief minister also said constructing roads in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh was the ""toughest battle in the world"". ""The biggest pain of the Naxalites is why we (the government) are building roads and electrifying the region,"" he told reporters here in Raipur.

"After asserting that the internet was around during Mahabharata and that Diana Hayden is not an “Indian” beauty, Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb has made yet another (for lack of a better word) boo-boo! Speaking to youngsters at a seminar organised by the Tripura Veterinary Council, the Tripura chief minister said the educated youth should ""set up  shops instead of running after political parties for several years to get government jobs and waste vital time of their life,” reported  . He added that apart from  shops, “milking cows is another option.” Deb said that a bank balance of Rs 5 lakh would be a reality for youngsters if they had started various projects under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. It is “narrow minded” to think that educated people should not get into farming or poultry. That, he believed, was the reason for unemployment.

" Questioning Rahul Gandhi's temple visits ahead of the coming Karnataka assembly polls, union minister and Karnataka election-in-charge Prakash Javadekar said Congress was earlier ""pseudo secular"" but is now ""pseudo Hindu."" ""They are changing brands. They were earlier pseudo secularists, now they represent pseudo Hinduism. People understand what is an election gimmick and what is true devotion,"" the minister said. He claimed that Gandhi did not go to temples in Delhi when he was elected Congress president, which was the biggest day in his life. ""He goes to temples in Gujarat and Karnataka because there is election. So it is a vote gimmick. But people are not fools. Robust common sense works and people understand who is a real devotee and who is an election devotee."" He took a dig at the ruling Congress in Karnataka, saying that on the one hand its leaders are visiting temples and on the other, brought out a circular from taking and appropriating all temples, mutts, under the endowment department. The circular was later withdrawn hurriedly under public pressure, he pointed out. Welcoming Gandhi to Karnataka on behalf of his party, the union minister said his arrival ensures BJP's victory. ""Congress president Rahul Gandhi is in Karnataka. We welcome him because wherever he goes, the BJP wins. This is the track record. It has been seen in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Assam, Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir and recently, Gujarat.""

" India stood firm on basic principles of multilateralism at the WTO's ministerial meeting last month in Argentina and would continue to work with other members to promote rule-based global trade, Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu said on Friday. The minister also said that the country's coalition partners extended their support not only for a permanent solution on the food security matter but also on other issues of interest of developing nations at the ministerial meet. Prabhu said this in a statement in the Rajya Sabha on India's stand at the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). ""India stood firm on its stand on the fundamental principles of the WTO including multilateralism, rule-based consensual decision making, an independent and credible dispute resolution and appellate process, the centrality of development and special and differential treatment for all developing countries,"" he added. The talks at the WTO's 11th ministerial conference collapsed after the US went back on its commitment to finding a permanent solution to the public food stockholding issue, a key matter for India. The four-day conference in Argentina, which ended without a ministerial declaration or any substantive outcome, did manage to make some feeble progress on fisheries and e-commerce by agreeing to work programmes. The minister said that in absence of a ministerial declaration, the existing mandates and decisions would remain valid and be carried forward. ""This ensures that the work will go forward and the WTO would continue to work on issues such as the permanent solution on public stockholding for food security purposes, agriculture subsidies and other issues,"" he said. Prabhu said that India's public stockholding programme would continue to be protected due to the interim solution that the government negotiated in 2014, which is available in perpetuity. Under the global trade norms, a WTO member country's food subsidy bill should not breach the limit of 10 percent of the value of production based on the reference price of 1986-1988. Apprehending that full implementation of food security programme may result in a breach of the WTO cap, India has been seeking amendments in the formula to calculate the food subsidy cap.",PTI,PTI
" Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday accused the Congress government in poll-bound Karnataka of adopting ""the model of political violence"" from Kerala, but assured people that BJP will end the violent targeting of political workers if it comes to power in the state. Addressing a series of campaign meetings for BJP, Singh also claimed that there have been 3,781 cases of suicide by farmers during the five-year Congress rule led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. ""It seems the Congress government in Karnataka has adopted the model of political violence from neighbouring Kerala. Many political workers were killed under Siddaramaiah's rule. The BJP will bring an end to the political violence after coming to power in Karnataka,"" he said. The campaign for the 224-member Karnataka Assembly is heating up with prominent leaders visiting the state and the political parties announcing their candidate lists for the polls. BJP, which is making an all-out effort to oust the Congress government from the state, on Monday released its  . With that, it has declared nominees for 220 seats. On 30 March, BJP president Amit Shah, on his fourth visit to the state after the announcement of the polling date, had accused the state government of unleashing violence against BJP and RSS workers. On Monday, Singh also expressed concern over the state of law and order in Karnataka, claiming not even senior government officials were safe. ""Who is responsible for the death of Mangaluru Deputy SP  ? Who humiliated Mysore Collector Shikha Rai? Even Lokayukta was stabbed in his office,"" Singh said. Ganapathy, 51, was found hanging from the ceiling fan at a lodge in Madikeri on 7 July, prior to which he gave an interview to a TV channel in which he held a state government minister and senior administration officials responsible ""if anything happens"" to him. Karnataka's Lokayukta   was injured at his office in Bengaluru in early March, allegedly by a man angry over Shetty's refusal to entertain his complaint. Singh said Siddaramaiah had promised to give Rs 1 lakh as assistance to the family of farmers who committed suicide but has not done that yet. ""It shows the insensitivity of the Siddaramaiah government."" Singh said the Siddaramaiah government claims it is "" "" — but in reality "" is "" (Siddharamaih government is a sleeping government). He said politics should not be guided by caste, religion or sect but by principles of justice and humanity. ""Congress is playing 'minority-majority' card just before elections,"" he said. The home minister alleged Congress has devised new ways to divert people's attention from its failure — it celebrated the 'Tipu Jayanti' but does not allow the celebration of 'Hanuman Jayanti'. Singh alleged corruption and Congress are the two sides of a coin but there has not been a single charge against any minister under the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre. In Karnataka however, Singh said, not much has changed in the past five years of Congress rule. The Centre gave more than Rs 2 lakh crore to Karnataka under the 14th Finance Commission, while the state had received only Rs 88,000 crore under the UPA dispensation, he said. Singh said BS Yeddyurappa, BJP's chief ministerial candidate, ran a farmer-friendly government in Karnataka and only he can provide a farmer-friendly government to the state. Referring to his close connection with Karnataka, Singh said when he became the BJP national president, Karnataka was the first southern state where the party formed a government. ""I have a close emotional connect with Karnataka,"" he said. In an obvious reference to the opposition parties move to impeach Chief Justice of India  , the home minister said nobody should diminish the importance of constitutional bodies and authorities of the country. ""May God give these people good sense,"" he said. Singh said the NDA government has introduced a scheme named 'Ayushman Bharat' to provide medical cover of Rs 5 lakh to 10 crore poor families of the country.

" Having fallen on hard times following the humongous iron ore mining scam, the resourceful Reddy brothers of Ballari are back in the reckoning, with the BJP fielding two of them for the political potboiler of an Assembly poll slated next month. The mining scam that rocked Karnataka not many years ago is no longer a reason for the BJP to jettison the influential Reddy brothers whom it has embraced once again. The party has fielded G Somashekhara Reddy in Ballari city, and his elder brother and former Ballari Lok Sabha member G Karunakara Reddy in Harappanahalli in Davanagere district. Though the most resourceful of them — G Janardhana Reddy — has been barred from entering Ballari, in accordance with his bail conditions in the illegal mining case, he is camping near Molakalmuru in Chitradurga district overseeing the campaign of his siblings as also the BJP, which is making a determined effort to form its government in the key southern state for a second time. The BJP has publicly distanced itself from Janardhana Reddy, with party chief Amit Shah recently saying it has nothing to do with him, but ground realities suggest otherwise. The Congress party and a section of the BJP see Shah's statement as mere public posturing. Janardhana Reddy, they say, has been given the task of galvanising the Reddy community votes for the saffron party in the region. The Reddy brothers, whose stock soared during the iron ore export boom, had played a key role in installing the BJP's first government in the south in 2008. At the height of their influence, the Reddy troika — two of whom were ministers and the third Somashekara Reddy the chairman of the Karnataka Milk Federation — were often accused of running the BJP government, before their clout waned. So complete was the sway of their mining cartel's stranglehold on the region's politics that it had prompted the then Lokayukta Santosh Hegde to refer to the then Bellary (now Ballari) district as ""the Republic of Bellary"". But the proverbial long arm of law caught up with Janardhana Reddy and he was jailed in the illegal mining case. He came out on bail after being behind bars for about three-and-a-half years. The upcoming elections in Karnataka are a test of sorts for the Reddy brothers. The Reddy brothers were in political wilderness during the 2013 polls, with the BJP steering clear of them. The BJP's chief ministerial nominee BS Yeddyurappa and Reddy brothers' close aide and Ballari strongman B Sriramulu had floated their own parties, hurting the saffron party's prospects in the 2013 polls. Much water has flowed under the bridge ever since. They returned to the BJP and Sriramulu became the Lok Sabha member from Ballari in 2014. Accompanied by Janardhana Reddy and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Sriramulu, the BJP's poster boy in this region, filed his papers from Molakalmuru 
Assembly segment on Saturday. Janardhana Reddy had also shared the dais with Yeddyurappa that day, leaving no one in doubt that the mining baron is no longer a political pariah for the BJP. TH Suresh Babu, a nephew of Sriramulu, is eyeing a hat-trick from Kampli in Ballari district. Sriramulu's uncle, Sanna Fakirappa has been fielded from Ballari Rural seat. The BJP is betting on the Reddy brothers and Sriramulu to deliver for the party in the region. Senior Congress leader in Ballari and MLC K C Kondaiah said, ""In 2013, their (Reddy brothers') influence was not there, and they were not in the picture. But the brothers and followers are fighting the elections this time."" ""Yeddyurappa and Sriramulu had their own parties in 2013 and BJP had a very meagre support then. Now all are consolidated. They are now fighting as a single BJP. We have to see,"" he said. The BJP suffered a setback in the run up to the elections as two-time Vijayanagara MLA Anand Singh quit the party and joined the Congress, which fielded him for the seat. 
He seems to be on a strong wicket there. Sitting Congress MLA from Ballari Rural N Y Gopalakrishna joined the BJP last week and the party has now fielded him from Kudligi constituency. The cut and thrust has made the battle for control of Ballari a prestige issue for both the Congress and BJP. Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi had contested her first election from Ballari and Amethi in Uttar Pradesh in 1999 and retained the latter after winning both. She had defeated BJP's Sushma Swaraj in Ballari after a high-voltage campaign that revolved around the ""Swadesi-Videshi"" theme",PTI,PTI

A bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra considered the submission of senior advocate Indira Jaising that Hussain had been brutally tortured in police custody and judicial intervention was needed. The bench also comprising Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud asked the senior lawyer to explain as to how a writ of habeas corpus (produce the body) can be filed in the present case as the accused, Hussain, is in the lawful custody of the police. Jaising referred to a Supreme Court judgement and said that such a petition can be filed even in case of custodial torture. The bench asked the state government to file the response in a week and asked the lawyers to serve a copy of the petition on the advocate general of the state. It also permitted the woman who had lodged an FIR against Hussain alleging rape, to file an application seeking to intervene in the matter. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on August 21. The court was hearing the submission of a close relative of Hussain, seeking an urgent hearing on the plea. The relative of Hussain sought his protection in police custody and alleged that he had been brutally beaten up in the alleged fake rape case. The habeas corpus writ petition, filed by a cousin of the witness, alleged that Hussain had been kept in illegal detention and was being subjected to custodial torture.

" The Madhya Pradesh Assembly's budget session began on Monday with Governor Anandiben Patel's address, even as the opposition Congress demanded waiver of farmers' loans and criticised the high VAT on petrol. Patel mentioned in her address that the state government has reduced the value-added tax (VAT) on diesel from 27 percent to 22 percent and that on petrol from 31 percent to 28 percent. However, the Congress members, including Mukesh Nayak, Sunderlal Tiwari, Dr Govind Singh, Bala Bachchan and Jitu Patwari, protested over it. ""Despite the reduction, the VAT on petrol and diesel is the highest in Madhya Pradesh across the country,"" said Bachchan, who is the Deputy Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly. The government has also imposed a cess of Re 1 per litre on petroleum products, he pointed out. He said the Congress wants these products to be brought under the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). When Patel highlighted the government's achievements in the agriculture sector, especially getting the 'Krishi Karman Award' for maximum agriculture production in the country, the opposition members raised the farmers' concerns and demanded that their crop loans be waived off. They also displayed a placard in the House demanding loan waiver for farmers. When the governor said that the government has not opened any new liquor shop in the state, the Congress members again raised their concerns over the issue but their words were inaudible amid the noise. Earlier, Assembly Speaker Dr Sitasharan Sharma mentioned in the House that governor Patel would only read out some select parts of her speech and not the full text. In her address, Patel highlighted the state government's various welfare schemes, including for crop insurance, the 'Bhavantar' scheme for farmers, encouragement given to cashless transactions in various sectors and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Ajay Singh, alleged that the government's achievements were ""a bundle of lies"" and criticised the governor's ""lacklustre"" speech. On the governor not reading out her complete address, Singh said, ""It is not a good tradition."" ""Even the ruling party members are not happy with it, leave alone the opposition,"" he claimed.

": The Supreme Court has sought the Centre's response on a plea by the CPM challenging the government's decision on issuing electoral bonds.

"The Supreme Court on Thursday, 8 March, set aside Kerala High Court's annulment of Hadiya’s marriage to Shafin Jahan. After the decision came out, Hadiya's father KM Asokan said that he will consider moving a review petition in the apex court against its recent judgment. ""Will consider filing a review petition,"" he told reporters. The bench, headed by CJI Dipak Misra, said it arrived at the conclusion after speaking to Hadiya, who said she entered the marriage of her own volition, reported Bar and Bench. The apex court also reportedly observed that the Kerala High Court “should not have annulled the marriage.” However, the bench held that the probe initiated by the National Investigation Agency into the case would continue, as per Bar and Bench. Responding to the court’s direction, Maninder Singh, appearing for the investigation agency, submitted to the court that “the probe is almost complete”. Meanwhile, Asokan maintained that his daughter's marriage with Shafin Jahan was an act of ""adjustment"" done by a group, reported PTI. He, however, expressed satisfaction over the Supreme Court stating that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) may continue its investigation in the matter, PTI further said. He also said that it was painful for a father to send his daughter with an 'extremist'. ""There are no words to explain it,"" Asokan said. Last week, Hadiya’s father had claimed before the apex court that his efforts had prevented his daughter from being transported to ""extremist-controlled territories"" of Syria to be used as a ""sex slave or a human bomb"". He was responding to an affidavit filed by Hadiya, who had earlier told the apex court that she had willingly converted to Islam and wanted to remain a Muslim. The apex court had on 22 February questioned whether the Kerala High Court could nullify a marriage between ""vulnerable adults"" after the father of the 25-year-old woman had justified the order. In an affidavit filed before the top court, Hadiya said that she had married Shafin Jahan on her own will and sought the court's permission to ""live as his wife"". She also claimed that her husband was wrongly portrayed as a terrorist by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and he had nothing to do with the Middle East-based terror group ISIS. On 27 November 2017, the apex court had freed Hadiya from her parents' custody and sent her to college to pursue her studies, even as she had pleaded that she should be allowed to go with her husband. The high court had annulled the marriage terming it as an instance of 'love jihad', following which Shafin Jahan had approached the apex court.

He refuted Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s claim that Gandhi’s allegations have international dimensions. “We wanted the Rafale deal to go through, which would generate thousands of jobs,” the Congress leader said. “I want to ask Nirmala Sitharaman where did she come across international conspiracy?” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, however, chose to train his guns on Gandhi’s brother-in-law Robert Vadra. “Rafale deal documents were recovered from Robert Vadra’s close friend Sanjay Bhandari during a raid in 2016 at his house,” Patra said, according to  . “How did these confidential documents reach there?” In 2012, the United Progressive Alliance government started negotiating with Dassault to buy 126 Medium Multi-Rule Combat Aircraft.

"Deviating from its stand against dynastic politics, the ruling BJP has awarded tickets to close family members of several party leaders to contest the 7 December Assembly election in Rajasthan.

" The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and the Assam government to file their objections to a report of NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela on use of five documents for verification of citizenship claims of around 40 lakh people who have been left out in the draft National Register of Citizens (NRC). A bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice R.F. Nariman considered the report of Hajela whether five documents, which were not allowed so far for considering the citizenship claims, can now be used. “We are of the view that all the stakeholders including the State of Assam and the Union of India should be allowed to file their objections to the stand taken by Hajela in his aforesaid report dated October 4, 2018, a copy whereof would be furnished by the Registry of this court to the following stakeholders in the next two days,” the bench said. It also granted opportunity to All Assam Students Union, All Assam Minorities Students’ Union, Jamait Ulama -i-Hind, Assam Public Works, Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha, National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Progressive), Indigenous Tribal Peoples Federation and Joint Action Committee for Bengali Refugees to file their objections, if any. The top court also directed Hajela to give a powerpoint presentation of the manner in which he had proceeded in preparation of the manual and the computer family tree for the purposes of deciding on the inclusion of names in the draft NRC. “The power-point presentation will be given by Hajela to the officials of the government of Assam and the Union of India in the presence of Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General or his authorised representative(s) as may be and also in the presence of one representative of all the other stakeholders,” the court said. It said that once written objections are received on or before October 30, further orders in the matter will be passed on November 1. For the time being, 10 legacy documents can be used for inclusion and exclusion in the draft NRC, which should have been issued by various authorities and corporations since midnight of March 24, 1971. These include land documents like registered sale deed, a permanent residential certificate issued from outside the State, passport and LIC insurance policy of the relevant period. Other documents which can be relied upon include any licence or certificate issued by a government authority of the relevant period, papers showing service or employment under government or public sector undertaking, bank or post office accounts, birth certificates, educational certificate and records or processes pertaining to courts, provided they are part of a processing in a judicial or revenue court.

"Per capita wealth changed very little across countries, even falling in 25 countries, between 1995 and 2014, a new World Bank report by Glenn-Marie Lange and co-authors shows. The report attempts to provide a more comprehensive measure of economic progress than gross domestic product (GDP) alone by considering the combined wealth from four different sources: produced capital (plants and factories), human capital, financial capital and natural capital (resources such as forests, minerals, etc). Low-income countries, where natural capital constituted a major share of wealth, doubled their wealth between 1995 and 2014, the report shows. But on a per capita basis, their wealth grew by only 17 percent over this period due to high population growth. South Asia saw among the biggest gains in per capita wealth over the past two decades, the report shows. But countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw faster growth in per capita wealth compared with India because of gains in human capital formation.

The benchmark Nifty on Friday, 16 March, posted its second-worst single-day fall of 2018 due to global and domestic political concerns. The escalation of the war of words between the US and China, the world’s two largest economies, sparked fears of a global trade war. This, coupled with a no-confidence notice against the Narendra Modi-led government, weighed on investor sentiment. This resulted in most Asian markets ending with losses. India was one of the worst-performing markets globally on Friday.

The CBEC received claims for refunds of about Rs 17,000 crore, but some of them couldn’t be processed due to errors made by exporters, a government official later told   requesting anonymity. There is a mismatch in the invoice number, taxable value and the amount of IGST paid mentioned in shipping invoices versus GST returns filed by exporters, CBEC had said in an earlier notification. Errors also include incorrect shipping bill and GST identification numbers. Since claims of exporters were not being processed due to this mismatch, CBEC had decided to manually match GST invoices and shipping bills filed till 31 December 2017 to expedite refunds.

It had purportedly said after 10 years of Congress rule, India was finally ready to welcome good times ahead. But with India's economic woes seemingly continuing, the Opposition has since used the same slogan to taunt and criticise the BJP on various issues. The Congress' tweet was just the latest in a long line of such barbs directed at the ruling government. And given how quickly it went viral, it seems to have struck a chord on social media as well. In the short time since it was put up on Thursday morning, the tweet had managed over 5,400 Likes and was inching towards 2,000 retweets as well.

" Expressing concern over the decline in the number of days of Parliament's functioning, Rajya Sabha members on Friday sought extending the sittings to a minimum of 120 days a year, along with the working hours by starting the proceedings an hour early at 10 am. Some members expressed concern over the frequent adjournments and disruptions and said the loss of working hours should be compensated either by adding more hours that day or by working on additional days during a session. The members expressed their opinion during a debate on a private member's legislation brought by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) member Naresh Gujral. The Parliament (Enhancement of Productivity) Bill 2017, among other things, seeks to establish an effective system to prevent and address the decline in productivity of Parliament due to disrupts by an appropriate legal framework. During the debate, some members also opined that the salary and allowances of members who disrupt proceedings, should be deducted on that particular day. Gujral, while moving the bill for consideration and passage, said, ""We have seen that over the years, now Parliament hardly meets 70 days in a year. ""Earlier, when Rajya Sabha started to meet in 1952 after Independence, Parliament would meet for over 100 days and gradually with period of time, successive governments have made sure that the duration of the sessions gets reduced."" He said the bills are piled up and public which spends lots of money to run this institution, face inconvenience. ""We are not meeting the way we should be. Members are disrupting Parliament and one feature of my bill is that if the proceedings are disrupted, then automatically the number of hours lost in disruption should get added to the session,"" he said, adding that it would make the government more accountable. In western democracies, Parliament meet almost six months a year, Gujral said, adding that the Parliament in India should meet at least four to five months in a year. ""At least, we should make sure that it should not be less than 120 days,"" he said, adding that small parties, which have issues to raise, suffer as they do not get enough time. Supporting the bill, Congress member Jairam Ramesh said the Rajya Sabha must have a system of a special session of 15 days, in which all parties should discuss important national issues. In the 1950s, Parliament used to meet over 125 days, which has started declining progressively. ""Over the last decades, the average is less than 70 days. One of the reasons for the decline is that whoever is in government, would like to minimise the time taken by Parliament,"" Ramesh said. Another reason for the decline, according to Ramesh, was the system of Standing Committees, which was instituted in 1993. ""Even if you add the time of Standing Committee and the House, the average is somewhere close to 90 days which is much lower than in the 1950s and 1960s,"" the Congress leader said. ""If the Lok Sabha is not able to meet 100 days, the Rajya Sabha should meet for 100 days,"" Ramesh said, adding that a Lok Sabha MP has to cater his constituency and may not be able to attend 100 days but Rajya Sabha members have no such compulsions. ""We must have a special session of 15 days a year in which no government business is transacted, but the views raised by various parties, big and small, is taken up for discussion,"" he said. Suggesting extension of the working hours of Parliament, Ramesh said ""why should we start at 11 am? Around the world, Parliament sitting starts at 9.30 or 10 am. When the half of the day is over, we come to Parliament,"" he said suggesting that Rajya Sabha members should start at 10 am.",Press Trust of India,PTI
"The CBI counsel on Monday opposed the applications filed by the advocate of Farooq Takla, who is an aide of mafia don Dawood Ibrahim and also one of the accused in the 1993 Mumbai blasts. As reported by  , the applications sought legal counsel and to not make a confessional statement. Takla has been remanded to police custody till 19 March by a special TADA court after being brought to Mumbai early 8 March. Dawood’s aide Farooq Takla was brought to Mumbai in the early hours of 8 March to face the special TADA Court for his involvement in the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts case. Takla was brought to Mumbai after being deported from Dubai. Farooq Takla was produced before the special court constituted under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, in Mumbai, the CBI confirmed to  . Takla is likely to be tried for conspiracy, murder, and terrorism charges in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case.  reported that National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval was believed to have played an important role in ensuring Takla's return to India. Takla was an accused in the blasts trial, along with gangster Dawood Ibrahim and a number of his other associates. Farooq Takla had reportedly fled from India after the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts. Interpol had issued a Red Corner Notice against Takla in 1995, for his involvement in the 1993 bomb blasts. Takla had fled the country in 1995, along with Dawood Ibrahim, Tiger Memon, Chota Shakeel, and other important members of the underworld organisation dubbed the ‘D-Company’,  added. Takla was brought back to India at 4.45 am on 8 March, Thursday,  reported. Public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said in a statement to ANI, that Farooq Takla being brought back to India, was a “huge success,” adding that Takla was involved in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, and that Takla has links which could be traced back to Dubai. Nikam’s statements come on the tail of CNN News-18’s report that Takla was the one managing Dawood Ibrahim’s operations in Dubai and the Middle East. Adding to Nikam’s statement, NCP leader and senior criminal lawyer Majeed Memon speculated that Farooq Takla’s return to India, “ shows he has expressed his willingness to come back for trial.” Memon added that there was no question of Takla being granted bail while being questioned CBI or while awaiting trial by the special TADA Court. Section (8) of the original Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act prohibits the grant of bail to anyone accused of an offence under the act, save for two exceptions: That the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for release on bail. Where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, but the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. As many as 27 others accused in the Mumbai blasts, including Ibrahim Kaskar and Tiger Memon, who are alleged to have been the brains behind the blasts, are still absconding from the grips of the Indian judiciary. The special TADA court had convicted two of the accused, Mohammed Taher Merchant, and Feroze Abdul Rashid Khan, in September 2017, giving them the death sentence. The men were tried and found guilty on charges including murder, waging war against the country, supplying arms and ammunition, and hatching a criminal conspiracy. While all six accused had been found guilty by the special TADA court in June 2017, one of the convicts, Mustafa Dossa, died of a heart attack on 28 June 2017. The CBI on Monday, 12 March opposed the applications put forth by Takla’s advocate Farhana Shah, which requested for a legal counsel being provided to him and to not make a confessional statement. According to  , the prosecution on behalf of the CBI, stated that the accused could not claim the right to maintain absolute silence and prevent criminal investigation of the crime. It filed its reply before the special TADA court. CBI counsel Deepak Salvi also said that having a legal counsel meet the accused, Takla, while he was still in CBI custody, would ‘disrupt the investigations’, the report adds. However, Shah responded to this by saying: She also cited the example of Taher Merchant, another accused in the 1993 case, saying that the CBI had then approved his application to meet with his legal counsel twice, for 15 minutes, while he was still in custody. Additionally, the report states, Shah had also referred to the provision of allowing home-cooked food for Takla while he was still in custody, in her application. The court is expected to make a decision on the applications filed by Shah for Takla, on Tuesday. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

" A day after Tamil Nadu chief minister K Palaniswamy welcomed the idea of disqualified party MLAs returning to his AIADMK, the ruling dispensation on Tuesday asserted that their homecoming was ""bound to happen."" Senior AIADMK leader and Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said those who have accepted the late chief ministers M G Ramachandran (AIADMK founder) and J Jayalalithaa, as their 'eternal leaders,' will return to the party fold. The AIADMK's mouthpiece, 'Namathu Puratchi Thalaivi Amma,' also extended an indirect invitation to the disqualified MLAs to return to the party. Speaking to reporters here, Jayakumar recalled the chief minister's statement on Monday in Tiruchirappalli that it ""is laudable"" if eight of the ex-MLAs owing allegiance to TTV Dinakaran joined AIADMK. He said, ""Those who went away, whether MLAs or ex-MLAs or even an ordinary supporter, they all should accept Amma and Puratchi Thalaivar (as leaders) -- it is for sure that those who have accepted them as their eternal leaders will return to the party."" While party supporters address Jayalalithaa as Amma, they hail MG Ramachandran as Puratchi Thalaivar (revolutionary leader). In Tamil, Jayakumar described the possible return of the disqualified MLAs as ""kaalathin kattayam"" (roughly translating to 'bound to happen'). ""They all have to come, they will come,"" he said but declined to reveal if any of the ex-legislators were in talks with the AIADMK high command in this regard. Dinakaran loyalist Thanga Tamilselvan had said he would withdraw his petition in the Madras High Court challenging his disqualifition by Assembly Speaker P Dhanapal, but ruled out joining the AIADMK, led by Palaniswamy and his deputy O Panneerselvam. He had said the people of his constituency have endorsed his decision to take back his plea in the court. Tamilselvan is one of the 18 MLAs who were disqualified last year following their revolt against the chief minister. A day after the factions led by Palaniswami and erstwhile rebel leader Panneerselvam merged on 21 August, 2017, MLAs owing allegiance to Dhinakaran met the then Governor C Vidyasagar Rao, and sought a ""change"" in leadership saying they had lost confidence in Palaniswamy. On 14 June, the Madras High Court delivered a split verdict on the petitions challenging disqualification of the 18 MLAs. While Chief Justice Indira Banerjee upheld the 18 September order of Speaker Dhanapal disqualifying the MLAs, Justice M Sundar disagreed with her and set it aside. The verdict had come as great relief for the Palaniswamy government as restoration of the membership of the MLAs could have brought it perilously close to losing majority in the event of their joining hands with opposition DMK-Congress-IUML alliance, which has a combined strength of 98 MLAs in the 234-member Assembly. In that eventuality, the Opposition's strength would have swelled to 117, including Dinakaran, who is the lone independent MLA. The AIADMK also has 117 members in the House, including the Speaker. Meanwhile, in a write-up titled 'Netru, Indru, Naalai' (Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow) the AIADMK mouthpiece recalled Jayalalithaa earlier having discarded her confidante, the jailed VK Sasikala, and her family members. While crediting the late chief minister for 'toiling' for the victory of the disqualified MLAs when they represented AIADMK, it also accused Dhinakaran of winning the December 2017 bypoll to RK Nagar here with its arch rival DMK's support. One has to ""sense this conspiracy,""it added. Those with gratitude should make it their motto to strive towards fulfilling Jayalalithaa's dream of ""a hundred years"" of AIADMK rule, it said.

"Firing a fresh salvo at the government, disgruntled BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Saturday asked his party colleagues and ministers to ""get rid of their fear"" and ""speak up for democracy"" like the four Supreme Court judges who came out publicly against the chief justice The former Union minister referred to the comments of the four judges to claim that the prevailing atmosphere was like the Emergency in 1975-77 and voiced concern over short parliamentary sessions. If Parliament is compromised, the Supreme Court is not in order, then democracy is threatened, he told reporters. Sinha said ""if four senior most Supreme Court judges say democracy is under threat, we have to take their words very seriously"""" ""Every citizen who feels for democracy should speak up. I will ask party (BJP) leaders and senior cabinet ministers to speak up. I will appeal to them to get rid of their fears and speak up,"" he said. Sinha, however, insisted that it was for the apex court to sort out the crisis after the four senior judges virtually revolted against the country's chief justice on Friday, raising questions on ""selective"" case allocation and certain 
judicial orders. Like the chief justice of India in the Supreme Court, the prime minister is also first among equals in the government and his cabinet colleagues should speak up, he said. Sinha, who has been a vocal critic of the Modi government over issues like demonetisation, GST and Kashmir, claimed that he was ""personally aware of the fear in which members of the cabinet in this government are working, and that also is a threat to democracy"". The BJP has in the past attributed Sinha's scathing criticism of the government to his being sidelined in the party with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley once dubbing him as a ""job applicant at 80"". Sinha was a cabinet minister in the first BJP-led NDA government and held finance and foreign affairs portfolios. In his press conference, Sinha also rejected suggestions that politicians should not wade into the judicial crisis, saying when four senior most SC judges have gone public, it was no longer an internal matter of the court and it was imperative for every concerned citizen to raise his voice. Political parties and Parliament should speak when four senior most judges had spoken about dangers to democracy, he said. Referring to the Winter Session and the first leg of the Budget Session to be held between 29 January-9 February, Sinha said he had never heard of such short sessions and this was also a threat to democracy. Citing the four judges’ comments that sensitive cases were assigned by the Chief Justice of India to particular benches, he said it must be clarified which were these cases.

" The war of words between the BJP and the Congress over the Vijay Mallya issue intensified Friday with the Opposition party alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""silence"" was an admission of guilt and the ruling party questioning links between the fugitive tycoon and the Gandhi family. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley helped the liquor baron flee India and accused them of maintaining a ""conspiratorial silence"" about a ""meeting"" Jaitley had with the defaulter businessman on 1 March, 2016. Holding that Jaitley has lost the legal, ethical and moral right to continue as minister and must resign, he said the silence of the Union minister and Modi pointed at their admission of guilt. Hitting back, the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) media head Anil Baluni fired off eight questions to the Congress. He asked if its president Rahul Gandhi and his mother and predecessor Sonia Gandhi did not fly free of cost in Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines in lieu of loans given to it. It was the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government which ""raised and protected"" the fugitive tycoon, he said, claiming that Rahul Gandhi suffers from ""ideological bankruptcy and does not know what he says, does and understands"". ""Why Rahul Gandhi does not answer these questions? Why his lips are sealed when faced with these burning questions. What can be a bigger evidence of corruption than the fact that it was the Congress government which raised and protected Mallya,"" he said. At his press conference, Surjewala asked why Modi was ""afraid"" to conduct a fair investigation in this matter. ""It shows that Prime Minister Modi is not just a part of this crime but the main culprit,"" he said. If Modi does not act, it will be proved that the 'chowkidaar' (watchman) is not just a 'Bhaagidaar' (partner) but is guilty of protecting a criminal, the Congress leader alleged. ""Multiple skeletons are tumbling out of the Modi government's cupboard unravelling a sinister conspiracy and collusion of government agencies, including CBI, ED, SFIO and others in permitting Vijay Mallya to escape the clutches of law,"" he told reporters. In his statement, Baluni cited the then-prime minister Manmohan Singh's reported comments in 2011 that Kingfisher Airlines, now defunct, needed to be helped and asked if it was not true that the then finance minister P Chidambaram ignored rules to provide relief to the loss-making airline. ""Is it not true that in exchange for providing (bank) loans to Mallya the then UPA chairperson and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and current Congress president Rahul Gandhi travelled free of cost in the airline's business class,"" he asked. He also repeated several allegations the ruling party has been levelling at the Congress. The two parties have been training guns at each other after Mallya claimed Wednesday in London that he had met Jaitley before leaving India. The finance minister refuted his claim, saying he had never give him an appointment but the businessman misused his privilege as a member of Parliament to accost him there but he asked him to approach his banker.

The TN parties and their leaders have been livid with the statements made by the Karnakataka CM Kumaraswamy and his father Deve Gowda that the issue of sharing of Cauvery waters could be resolved through talks between the governments of the riparian states – which effectively meant throwing into dustbin the Cauvery Management Authority (CMA) and the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC) constituted by the Centre following the Supreme Court direction.

": All guns blazing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday mounted a scathing attack on the Congress over corruption, and asserted it will become ""Punjab, Puducherry, Parivar"" Congress after its defeat in the Karnataka Assembly polls. With the D-day for the polls drawing closer, Modi upped the ante against the Siddaramaiah government, alleging it has become a ""corruption tank"" for the Congress with a pipeline connected to Delhi, ""where the money reaches directly"". He also accused the top Congress leadership of auctioning tickets, party positions and even the chief minister's post. ""After 15 May (when poll results will be declared), Indian National Congress will be reduced to 'PPP Congress' — P for Punjab, P for Puducherry, and P for Parivar (family),"" Modi told an election rally in Gadag, where he predicted the state's ruling party would be decimated in the elections. He accused the Congress of ""auctioning"" party tickets and posts, and recalled how a string of scams rocked the erstwhile UPA government. ""After the helicopter scam, coal scam, CWG scam and many others, the Congress has now started a tender system there is tender for ticket distribution, for selecting leaders, for choosing even the chief minister. ""Their leaders in Karnataka have been told by those above them that the person who promises to send the highest amount of money to Delhi every month will become the chief minister,"" he alleged. Modi said despite a string of electoral losses in Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Tripura the Congress was not as worried as it is now when defeat stares it in the face. ""I tell you why.....Because their ministers and leaders in Karnataka have built a tank here. A part of money looted from people is taken home and the rest is put in that tank. The tank is linked to Delhi through a pipeline which carries the money directly to Delhi. ""They are worried about what will happen to the party if this government goes. Be alert, be awake. If the Congress comes to power, its government will do nothing but loot,"" he said. Modi said to fill the ""corruption tank"", the Congress has created a network of extortion mafia, and it is worried what will happen to that. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was once again in Modi's line of fire, with the prime minister calling his government ""seedha rupaiah sarkar"" (government that takes bribe). ""Money is bad,"" he noted, recalling what saint poet Shishunala Sharifa once said. But for Karnataka's Congress government, it is "" (when it comes to money not even your relations are important)."" ""Your chief minister has changed the saying itself...  ; seeda seeda rupaiya (Relations are important and money is even more important),"" Modi said. Speaking about the contentious Mahadayi river issue over which Goa and Karnataka are locked in a protracted dispute, Modi claimed, the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi had said during Goa Assembly elections in 2007 that her party was ""committed"" to not allowing Karnataka its share of water. ""Now that they are out of power in Goa, they are instigating people of Karnataka on the Mahadayi issue. Their job (atkana, latkana, bhatkana) to block, leave things hanging fire, and mislead people. Instead of finding a solution to Mahadayi dispute, Congress government sent it to a tribunal,"" he said. Earlier addressing an election rally in Tumakuru, Modi alleged that the Congress and JD(S) have entered into a ""secret"" pact for the Karnataka polls. ""If anyone is protecting the Congress, it is the JD (S). Congress and JD(S) have a secret understanding, an understanding behind the curtains,"" he said. 
Modi said the Congress, which ruled the country for decades, with ""one family"" in power for most part, neglected the poor and farmers. ""Garibi, garibi, garibi (poverty, poverty, poverty) was their constant rant. But once the son of a poor mother became the prime minister, they clammed shut, now they don't talk about poverty,"" he said, and asked voters to ""punish"" the Congress for Karnataka's better future.",PTI,PTI
"The BJP's Karnataka unit on Friday accused the Congress government in the state of ""failure"" on the law and order front, and demanded that the Governor recommend imposition of President's rule in the state. The state BJP chief Yeddyurappa also hit out at Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for allegedly instructing prison officials to provide ""special amenities"" to deposed AIADMK leader VK Sasikala who is lodged in the central jail in Bengaluru in connection with a disproportionate assets case. Slamming the government for the attack on Lokayukta P Vishwanatha Shetty, who was stabbed multiple times in his cabin on Wednesday, Yeddyurappa said, ""this shows that there is no civilian government in place in the state."" He said the attack on the Lokayukta has become nationwide news and brought down the credibility of the state government in front of the world. ""The government that cannot provide security to the honourable judge is not fit to continue in power even for a minute. Governor has to immediately take action and should recommend President's rule,"" he told reporters in Bengaluru. The former chief minister also said he along with Union Minister Ananth Kumar had met Union home minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Thursday on the matter. Alleging that the law and order situation has been consistently deteriorating, Yeddyurappa said Karnataka has, for the first time in its history, become ""a   state"", where murders and extortion have become common. Giving numbers indicating increase in cases of murder, atrocities against Dalits, incidents of rape and dacoity, he said, ""This is Siddaramaiah government's record...the chief minister has to give an explanation to the people of the state."" Yeddyurappa targeted the government for repeated incidents of ""attacks and murders"" of BJP and right wing activists. He also accused the Siddaramaiah government of weakening the institution of Lokayukta by bringing in the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which works according to its instructions, to target political opponents. Referring to the allegation made by former DGP Prisons Sathyanarayana Rao that certain amenities were provided to Sasikala in jail following instructions from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Yeddyurappa called it ""shameful"". ""This for the first time in the history of the country, a chief minister has tried to help an inmate (in jail). This is an insult to our democratic system."" Terming it contempt of court, he said the governor has to initiate legal action against the chief minister.

" Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday blamed the BJP-RSS for the recent violence at Koregaon-Bhima and the resulting caste tension in Maharashtra. Addressing a public meeting at Sindhkhedraja in Buldhana district of Maharashtra after paying homage to Jijabai, the mother of warrior king Shivaji, the AAP supremo said the Maratha king had worked to achieve an all-inclusive society. The meeting was held on the occasion of Jijabai's birth anniversary. ""The BJP-RSS (supporters) attacked Dalits at Koregaon Bhima, leading to caste tensions. We condemn this,"" he said and alleged, ""To instigate riots, on the basis of caste and religion, and rule is the BJP's creed."" Dalits visiting a war memorial at Koregaon Bhima in Pune district to commemorate an 1818 battle — in which the army of the East India Company, consisting of Dalit Mahar soldiers, had defeated the forces of the Brahmin Peshwa rulers — had come under attack on 1 January. It had led to protests in various parts of Maharashtra. Some pro-Hindutva leaders had opposed the 200th anniversary celebrations of the battle. Kejriwal also criticised the BJP-led Maharashtra government for allowing private schools to flourish allegedly at the cost of government schools, saying that a government that could not run schools had no right to rule. He also alleged that the BJP in Maharashtra had ""crushed"" the dreams of social reformer couple Mahatma Phule and Savitribai Phule, as well as that of Shivaji. The AAP leader pointed out that when he became the chief minister of Delhi three years ago, the condition of the government schools was bad in the national capital. ""Only the poor used to send their children to the government schools then. In three years, we have started 300 new state-of-the-art government schools with modern amenities. ""The Delhi government's budget is Rs 40,000 crore and still we managed to repair the schools and start new ones. The Maharashtra government's budget is Rs 3 lakh crore and still it is shutting down the government schools,"" he said. Stating that his government had conducted an audit of the power companies in the national capital, Kejriwal said ""today, Delhi has the cheapest power tariff"", whereas earlier it had the highest tariff. He said the farmers of the country needed to come together to launch an agitation, demanding the implementation of the Swaminathan Committee report on remunerative prices for their produce. ""We gave Rs 50,000 per hectare to the farmers in Delhi when they faced a crop-loss due to unseasonal rains,"" he said.

"They say politics is the art of the possible. But weaved around that saying are a few improbable no-go areas and political myths: For instance, who can align with whom and what alliances can never be. Lately, several of those myths have been busted with the Bahujan Samaj Party-Samajwadi Party alliance in Uttar Pradesh, Janata Dal (United)-Rashtriya Janata Dal becoming friends in Bihar (for a while), the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) combine in Karnataka, growing proximity between Congress and Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh, Trinamool Congress and the Left shedding their enmity and coming closer. Many such permutations and combinations have emerged in other parts of the country with a singular aim: To stop the onward march of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP or at least create obstacles in their path. Even in this season of political alignments and realignments, the possible coming together of the Shiv Sena (considered blatantly communal by secularists) and the Congress (the supposed fountainhead of “secular” politics) was considered extremely unlikely. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, one of the possible prime ministerial candidates of the anti-Modi camp, seems to be moving in the direction of making what was once thought impossible possible. That too at a time when a highly-charged political discourse on the second draft of National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, which seeks to identify illegal Bangladeshi immigrants who entered India after 24 March, 1971,  yet again brought to the fore Indian politics' secular-communal divide. Mamata is positioning herself to be in the leadership position of the other side of that political divide. Two of the most defining pictures of Mamata's visit to New Delhi on Wednesday were her meeting with Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut, the most trusted lieutenant of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and her meeting with Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia. Besides discussing fallout of NRC, the purpose of Mamata’s meeting with these leaders and a host of others was to invite them to attend a grand Opposition rally on 19 January, 2019, in Kolkata. The rally would sound bugle for 2019 elections against Modi and BJP. . In any case, the Shiv Sena chief has, for long, been looking for an opportunity to be seen at the high table of the anti-Modi coalition. But until now, an invite remained elusive. Uddhav famously broke ranks with BJP and National Democratic Alliance when Pratibha Patil was presidential candidate in UPA-I and when Pranab Mukherjee was presidential candidate in UPA-II. On a number of occasions, Uddhav and Shiv Sena berated Modi and his policies and even praised Rahul's leadership. But he was not sent any invite by the Congress. To Uddhav's credit, he has been fighting hard to shed the tag of ""politically untouchability"". Mamata has provided him the opportunity to stand on the podium with so-called secular leaders such as Mayawati, Akhilesh, Tejashwi Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal, MK Stalin, Kumaraswamy and so on. But the biggest photo-op of the day, if it occurs on 19 January, would be Thackeray sharing the dais with Rahul, along with a host of other potential UPA-III or hypothetical Federal Front allies. While Congress has not confirmed whether Rahul and Sonia will attend the rally, the hype is already building. It would be difficult for the Gandhis to stay away from the venue where other anti-Modi parties will make Mamata’s new found slogan ""Dui hajaar uneesh (2019), BJP finish"" as their theme song for parliamentary election. If Rahul and Uddhav share the dais with Sharad Pawar in Kolkata then it will set off even more speculation: of whether the Congress-Shiv Sena and NCP can come together in Maharastra to take on the BJP. It is possible that the Maharastra Assembly elections will be held along with the parliamentary polls in April or May 2019. By greeting Uddhav on his birthday on 27 July through Twitter — “Best wishes to Shri Uddhav Thackeray  , on his birthday. I wish him good health and happiness always”— Rahul indicated he has softened on Uddhav and is not averse to engaging with him.

"Senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who has turned a strong critic of the central government, launched 'Rashtra Manch' (national forum) on 30 January at Constitution Club of India, New Delhi. He said the body is for political leaders and others ""concerned"" with the prevailing situation in the country. Trinamool Congress MP Dinesh Trivedi, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari and AAP leader Ashutosh and ambassador KC Singh marked their presence at the conference. There was also speculation about a disgruntled MP of the ruling alliance joining the forum. Asked on Monday about others who would join him, Sinha had said it would be disclosed on the day of the launch but added that they would join the forum in their individual capacity to air their concern over the current situation. At the conference, Sinha said that the forum should not be mistaken for being an organisation but a “nationwide movement” which is for the people and by the people. “All those who have gathered here from all walks of life connect on an ideological level since many pressing matters have sprung up of late which are troublesome for the public today,” he said. The former administrator reiterated that the forum will not turn into a political party in future. “This is the Budget week and our Parliament is being disparaged during the Session. Does this bode well for our democracy ? Where is our Parliament heading?” said the former finance minister. Sinha also urged that answers must be sought as to why the alleged allocation of cases to selected benches happened. He added that government agencies ranging from the Enforcement Directorate, the Income tax department, the CBI etc are being misused, especially by political competitors. His address drew applause from the audience when he remarked that farmers’ distress is the biggest crisis one needs to take charge of. “Farmers have been reduced to being beggars by the current government,” he remarked. Taking a dig at the ruling party, he said the most leaders at the Centre are fearful, except actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha and himself. The former civil servant said that the “gathering is an affirmation that we have already freed ourselves from any sort of fear.” Sinha, a former minister in the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has often criticised the incumbent government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a host of issues, including its economic policy and the recent judicial crisis. ""Whatever you do, I will not run away from my duties. Calling the youth of the country to join the movement,"" he said in a tweet. The development is likely to be seen as an attempt to step up an attack against the government and to build an atmosphere against the BJP-led NDA in the countdown to the next Lok Sabha polls, scheduled in the first half of next year.

"A three-judge in-house committee has found substance in the allegations against an Allahabad High Court judge, Justice SN Shukla, in the medical admissions scam, and has recommended his removal to Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra,   reported. On the committees recommendation, the Chief Justice advised Justice Shukla to either resign or take voluntary retirement – an option the Allahabad HC judge refused to take. Left with no other option, the CJI advised the Chief Justice of Allahabad HC to withdraw work from Shukla. This cleared the way for the CBI to register a case against Justice Shukla in connection with the scam that rocked the judiciary. Justice Shukla, while heading a division bench in the High Court, allegedly defied categorical restraint orders passed by a CJI-led bench last year to permit private colleges to admit students for the 2017-18 academic year. An in-house committee – comprising Madras High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee, Sikkim High Court Chief Justice SK Agnihotri and Madhya Pradesh High Court Judge Justice PK Jaiswal – was set up after the Advocate General of Uttar Pradesh complained to the CJI on 1 September 2017. Once the President and Prime Minister get a word from the Chief Justice of India recommending the removal the HC judge, the Rajya Sabha chairperson, who is also the Vice President, appoints a three-judge inquiry panel in consultation with the CJI under the Judges (Enquiry) Act 1968, to look into the allegations examined by the in-house committee. It’s the committee’s task to examine evidence and record findings which form the basis of whether or not the removal will be debated in the Upper House. After inquiring into the allegations of favours granted by Justice Shukla to private medical colleges through judicial orders, the committee headed by Justice Banerjee gave a scathing report against the Allahabad HC judge. The report states that “the committee concluded there is sufficient substance in the allegations” against Shukla and aberrations on his part were sufficient to warrant a removal. This alleged aberration by the HC judge led to a CBI probe and the subsequent arrest of former Orissa HC Judge Justice IM Quddusi. The CJI, however, didn’t immediately give the CBI a green light to register an FIR against Shukla as a matter against a sitting judge needed an in-house probe first. However, in light of the in-house committee report, a CBI inquiry looks likely. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint,The Quint

"Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy has come under mounting pressure from the ruling coalition partner Congress to roll back the hike in petrol and diesel prices announced in the state budget last week. A day ahead of Kumaraswamy's reply to the debate on the budget in the Assembly, senior Congress leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah said he had written to Kumaraswamy asking him to withdraw the hikes as it would affect the common man. Siddaramaiah pointed out that the Congress was protesting against the BJP government at the Centre over the fuel price hike and had made it a major issue. ""The Congress party has been protesting at the national level against the rise in the prices of fuel. We fought the BJP during the state polls over the issue of the rice in fuel prices. Our national leaders have also been campaigning against the central government over this issue. In this situation you have announced a hike in fuel prices which will result in a rise in the cost of living of the common man. You must reconsider this decision.""

In his letter, Siddaramaiah also sought reconsideration of the decision to reduce the supply or rice. Expressing ""surprise"" over this decision, Siddaramaiah said the subsidy amount that his government had earmarked was Rs 2,450 crore and by reducing rice supply by two kg, Rs 600-700 crore can be saved. But reduction in the quantity may increase the burden on the poor, he said, adding that he came to know from party leaders and activists across Karnataka that people have opposed this move. Some Congress MLAs believe they have lost moral authority to slam the Modi government on fuel price hike because Karnataka too has raised them,  . In the coalition government's maiden budget last week, Kumaraswamy, who holds the finance portfolio,had proposed hike in the price on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.14 and Rs 1.12 per litre respectively as part of resource mobilisation efforts following the farm loan waiver, which is expected to cost the exchequer Rs 34,000 crore. In his budget speech, Kumaraswamy had defended the fuel price hike, saying the government needed to augment resources for the welfare needs and that it was a modest increase. He has responded to the criticism over the hike stating that fuel prices had been increased nine times by the BJP government at the Centre over the past four years. He had also announced a reduction in the rice quota issued to BPL families by two kg and decided to supply only five kg per month to an individual under the ""Anna Bhagya"", a flagship scheme of the previous Siddaramaiah government.

"Stating that reservation will not guarantee employment as jobs are shrinking, Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday, 5 August, said that there is a ""school of thought"" which wants policy-makers to consider the poorest of poor in every community. Gadkari was responding to reporters' questions on the ongoing agitation by the Marathas for reservation and similar demands by other communities in Maharashtra: ""So one school of thought is that a poor person is a poor person; he has no caste, creed or language. Whatever may be the religion – Muslim, Hindu or Maratha (a caste) – in all communities, there is one section which has no clothes to wear, no food to eat. One school of thought also is (that) we must also consider the poorest of the poor section in every community,"" he said. However, in a later tweet, Gadkari clarified that he did not imply a change in reservation criteria from caste to economic condition. Maintaining that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was trying to resolve the Maratha quota demand by holding talks, Gadkari urged people to maintain peace. ""The responsible political parties must not add fuel to the fire,"" he added. Development, industrialisation and good prices for rural produce would ease the economic distress that the Maratha community is suffering from, he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

"The 84th Plenary of the Congress party in New Delhi concluded with party president Rahul Gandhi making a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah. He said, “They (people) will accept a man accused of murder as the President of the BJP, but they will never ever accept the same in the Congress Party because they hold Congress in the highest regard.” Hitting back at the Congress chief over his attack on Amit Shah, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that it was astonishing that the Congress president chooses to make allegations against the BJP chief even though he has been cleared by a court. ""Gandhi himself is out on bail in Herald case, whereas our party President Amit Shahji, has been cleared by court,"" she said. Gandhi also laid out the roadmap for the Congress party ahead of 2019 elections and said there will be major restructuring in the internal functioning of the party. He admitted that the last Congress government was not able to meet the expectations of the people. He said, “I don't say it with happiness, but the last government we formed did not stand up to the expectations of the people. The people of the country were let down by us.” Stressing the need for discipline, and said, “Let us put all differences aside and work together to ensure victory for the party.” The Congress leader added that the corrupt and powerful today ""control conversation"" in the country and said, “They tell Muslims of India who never went to Pakistan and supported this great nation, ‘You don’t belong here’. They tell the Tamils, ‘Change your beautiful language’, they tell people of North-East, ‘We don’t like what you eat’, they tell women, ‘Dress properly or we’ll thrash you’.” In a direct hit at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi said Modi was not fighting corruption, but was ""corruption himself"" and under him, the country is controlled by ""corrupt and powerful"". Referring to the former Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Lalit Modi and diamond jeweller Nirav Modi, who are accused in different cases of fraud, he said that ""Modi gives Modi Rs 30,000 crores of your money and in turn, Modi gives Modi money for marketing Modi and fighting elections"". In response, Sitharaman termed Gandhi’s attempt to link the Prime Minister with the fugitives ""a fake narrative"". Responding to the above comment, BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “Rahul Gandhi's rant was shameful. The way he spoke of the judiciary was irresponsible.” Recalling the two warring sides of the epic Mahabharat, Gandhi said the BJP, like the Kauravas, fought for power, while his party, on the lines of the Pandavas, battled for truth. Taking another jibe at the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the Congress President said, ""(Mahatma) Gandhi spent 15 years in jail and died for the nation. But India must never forget that while our leader slept on the floor in jail, (Vinayak Damodar) Savarkar wrote a letter to the British begging for mercy and clemency.” Terming Gandhi’s speech the “rhetoric of a loser” and “devoid of substance”, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the party which questioned the ""fundamental existence"" of Lord Ram today wants to be identified itself with the Pandavas. Javadekar also reacted to his remarks and said, ""He has insulted Hindu religion and people's faith. He has also insulted patriotism by criticing Vir Savarkar and also attacking judiciary. Nobody has accused PM personally but he has attempted to do so."" Taking the ruling BJP head-on, Gandhi said the party sought to divert people's attention from issues such as unemployment and farm distress with ""fancy events"". “Instead of acknowledging the challenges facing the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi diverts our attention from our problems. We are being told that our problems only exist in our imagination,” he said. Union HRD Minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar responded saying he should apologise for his party's misdeeds first and then attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""While accusing the Modi government, he forgets that Congress did worst of genocide of Sikhs, they brought censorship in media and are known for all kinds of corruption and scams. He should first apologise for all that,"" Javadekar said. Holding that his party spoke on behalf of the country, Gandhi said, ""The BJP is the voice of an organisation, and the Congress is the voice of a nation.” Gandhi voiced the hope that India would, in the next decade, play an all-important role on the global stage. ""There are two visions in the world – of US and China. In 10 years, I want to see India's vision there,"" he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

""We have to accept what the Supreme Court finally decides and if we have any problem, then we can go back to the Supreme Court and explain. ""I think just as much as it is important to respect religion, it is important to respect institutions of our constitution, and for all sensible and responsible citizens, it is important to maintain a balance,"" he said.

" The DMK launched a frontal attack on the BJP-led central government on Saturday, accusing it of running an ""electoral dictatorship"" and vowing to ""defeat"" the national party's ""saffronisation dreams"". A meeting of the party's district secretaries, MPs and MLAs held under its president MK Stalin said the party was ready to ""pay any price"" to uphold constitutional values. The meeting, the first one to be headed by Stalin following his 28 August elevation as party chief, faulted the Centre on issues ranging from demonetisation, the Rafale deal, NEET and the prevailing economic situation. ""The BJP government is ignoring the interests of Tamil Nadu, affecting plurality and promoting communalism, even as human rights activists and those opposed to the BJP are being painted as anti-nationals,"" a resolution adopted in the meeting said. The resolution titled ""Will reject BJP's saffronisation dreams"" charged that media critical of the BJP government is being ""intimidated"" while Dalits and minorities were being targeted in many places. An ""undeclared Emergency"" was, therefore, in place, it said. ""The BJP has installed an electoral dictatorship and has been running an anti-people government for the last four years,"" the Dravidian party charged, adding that such an ""electoral dictatorship"" was challenging parliamentary democracy. The DMK also charged the BJP with controlling institutions like the Election Commission of India, Income Tax Department and CBI, adding ""there is a crisis"" even in the judiciary, referring to the outburst by four senior Supreme Court judges earlier this year. While demonetisation was announced in ""haste"", the GST which was rolled out last year was a ""goof-up"", it said, and referred to the falling value of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, leading to rise in fuel prices and increasing current account deficit. These had severely hurt the economy, the party added. Furthermore, DMK will never allow BJP's ""communal"" designs to take shape in the state and will ""pay any price to uphold the Preamble of the Constitution,"" it said. Training its guns on the Tamil Nadu government led by arch-rival AIADMK, the DMK charged that the ruling party had become the ""epitome of corruption"" and vowed to unseat it. It announced statewide protests against the government on 18 September. It also called for the dismissal of state Health Minister C Vijaya Baskar and removal of police chief TK Rajendran, on whose premises the CBI had conducted searches on Thursday in connection with the Gutka scam, relating to alleged payoffs by a manufacturer. The meeting also demanded immediate release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, following a direction from the Supreme Court that the state governor can consider the mercy plea of one of them, AG Perarivalan. The Tamil Nadu cabinet must meet immediately and adopt a resolution on the matter and send it to the governor, the DMK demanded.",Press Trust of India,Press Trust of India
"Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said it was time for his party workers to call out Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “bogus promise of achche din”, and work hard to provide an alternative to people.  Gandhi, who addressed the Congress Parliamentary Party at Parliament House, said corruption, economic failure, incompetence and social divisiveness have reached their zenith under the current government. “People of India are looking up to the Congress and its allied parties to help remove the Modi government and replace it with one which will listen to them, understand their problems and provide solutions to help reduce poverty, unemployment and inequality in the country,” PTI quoted the Congress leader as saying. “There is a great responsibility that is being placed on all of us today, to win this historic struggle between the forces of democracy and social justice versus those of autocracy and social hierarchy.” Gandhi recalled Modi’s remarks in 2014, when he said that India had been a slow “passenger train” for 70 years. “Give me your votes, said Modi ji, and I will take you on the best and most comfortable journey of your life,” the Congress president said. “Four years of Modi rule later, sadly, India today looks more like a train that is being driven to disaster by an autocratic, incompetent and arrogant driver, who does not care what happens to the passengers he is responsible for.” Gandhi also attacked the Modi government over the Rafale deal with France. “The Rafale scam, involving over Rs 1.3 lakh crores of public money and designed to bail out debt-ridden corporate cronies of Modi ji, is symbolic of the true ‘sanskar’ [values] of this government – Raam naam japna, paraya maal apna [pretending to be pious and god-fearing, take what’s not rightfully yours],” the  quoted him as saying.   Gandhi asked party members to restore hope among farmers and the youth, give relief to ordinary families, ensure the safety of women and protect Dalits.  He talked about the Muzaffarpur shelter home rape case. “Reports of mass rape of little girls at Muzaffarpur in Bihar are horrifying,” Gandhi said. “Lawmakers and leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the National Democratic Alliance are protecting the culprits.” The Congress chief said Modi had stayed silent about the rapes in Muzaffarpur and in Uttar Pradesh, PTI reported. “The prime minister speaks on everything – bullet train, aeroplanes, toilets, but not women,” Gandhi said while addressing a Mahila Adhikaar Sammelan at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi. “He had talked about changing India, had talked about 70 years...what they have done against women in the last four years, had not happened in the previous 3,000 years in this country.” Gandhi said his aim was to have 50% women members in the Congress, which the BJP could never have because the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is a “male chauvinist organisation”. “The day a woman enters the RSS, it will not remain the RSS,” the Congress president claimed.  He promised to include more women in central units of the All India Congress Committee. “We are going to create space for you in the Congress party,” Gandhi said. “We need to create special space for women in our party. We need to create a space at every level.”  The Congress chief also said that the real aim of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign was to tell people to protect their daughters from BJP MLAs.

": Wondering why Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik has been supporting the NDA government's ""wrong"" decisions, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on said the BJP and the BJD might go for some post-poll understanding in 2019. The people of Odisha have the right to know as to why Patnaik, also the ruling BJD president, frequently supports Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decisions even eight years after their break up, Anand said. The BJD had snapped its 11-year-old ties with the BJP before the 2009 Lok Sabha election over the seat sharing issue. ""If you are secular why do you support Narendra Modi while all secular parties have been opposing him,"" said the former union minister. Sharma was referring to the recent election for the post of deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha where nine MPs of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) supported NDA candidate Harivansh. He said despite request by many non-BJP leaders, Patnaik preferred to go with the NDA candidate. Asked whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi had called Patnaik seeking support of the BJD MPs in the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman's election, Sharma avoided a direct reply. ""I do not want to embarrass a chief minister. Many leaders including chief ministers have reached out to Patnaik seeking BJD MPs support. But, he preferred to go with the NDA after getting a phone call from the prime Minister,"" he said. On whether he foresees revival of the BJD-BJP alliance, Sharma said the two parties might opt for post-poll understanding. ""They may not go for alliance before elections. But, the BJP has been keeping relationship with the BJD because the BJP knows that their seats will drastically fall in many states (in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls),"" he said. He mentioned states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi where the BJP would lose seats. So, in a ""Look East policy"", the BJP has been eyeing Odisha, West Bengal and Assam and trying to secure more seats from these three states. ""As they may not win many seats in Odisha, the BJP may get support of the BJD after the elections,"" Sharma said. To a query about reason behind Patnaik's support to Modi, Sharma said the BJP has been misusing central agencies like the CBI, the ED and others to settle scores with political opponents. He, however, did not say whether the BJD is also being threatened by the BJP. Sharma also referred to the reported statement of Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan yesterday that Patnaik might have some compulsion to support the NDA. ""Therefore, we want to know from Patnaik what is the reason behind his party's support to the BJP,"" Sharma said, adding that a ""match fixing is there between the BJD and the BJP and their opposing each other in the state is just an eyewash"". The Congress leader said Patnaik has supported the Centre on demonetisation, GST, no-confidence motion and now in the elections for deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Sharma also came down heavily on the NDA government over issues such as decline in GDP rate, frail economic growth, decline in investment ratio and alleged corruption in Rafale jet deal. The country has been passing through a crisis ever since the NDA government came to the power and there is an effort to nullify all the institutions, he claimed.",Press Trust of India,FP Staff
"President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday accepted the resignations of Telugu Desam Party MPs Ashok Gajapathi Raju and YS Chowdary from the Union Cabinet, PTI reported. Chowdary was the minister of state for science and technology and earth sciences, while Raju was in charge of the civil aviation ministry. “Further, as advised by the prime minister, the president has directed that the work of the Ministry of Civil Aviation will be looked after by the prime minister,” the Rashtrapati Bhavan said in a statement. After submitting his resignation on Thursday, Chowdary had compared the decision to an unfortunate divorce and said they had to resign from their Cabinet positions because of “unavoidable circumstances”.

"Sticking to the convention of the senior-most judge succeeding the incumbent CJI, the President has approved the appointment of Justice Ranjan Gogoi as the next Chief Justice of India. He will be sworn in by the President on 3 October, after current CJI Dipak Misra retires. As per convention, the outgoing Chief Justice sends the recommendation for who should be his successor 30 days before he is to demit office. The Ministry of Law & Justice has to then forward the recommendation to the Prime Minister, who advises the President about it. The President then needs to approve the recommendation, after which the new CJI is sworn in. The Union Law Ministry had written to Chief Justice of India Justice Dipak Misra requesting him to forward the name of the judge who will succeed him upon his retirement on 2 October. CJI Misra replied with Justice Gogoi’s name on 4 September. The move comes after months of speculation in legal circles over whether Justice Ranjan Gogoi (the next in line according to seniority) could be superseded when current CJI Misra retires on 2 October 2018. Justice Gogoi was one of the four Supreme Court judges who held an unprecedented press conference in January 2018, raising concerns about the administration of the Supreme Court and the independence of the judiciary.

": Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu's rejection of the opposition's impeachment motion against Chief Justice Dipak Misra triggered a political slugfest today, with the Congress saying it would challenge the ""illegal"" order in the Supreme Court while the BJP ""thanked"" him for warding off an ""act of blasphemy"" towards the Constitution. The Left also criticised Naidu with CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury saying his order showed ""a certain degree of non-application of mind"" as he did not follow laid-down rules. Following extensive consultations with legal and constitutional experts, Naidu on Monday rejected the notice given by the Opposition parties for impeachment of CJI Dipak Misra citing lack of substantial merit in it. Congress leader Kapil Sibal, seen a prime mover for the impeachment motion against the CJI, told reporters that Naidu's decision had ""shattered"" the confidence of people. “To say the least, the order is unprecedented, illegal, ill-advised and hasty,"" Sibal said, adding that it had been passed without a full-fledged enquiry. ""We will certainly move a petition in the Supreme Court to challenge this order... It is illegal because the chairman has passed an order which is required to be passed after a full-fledged inquiry,"" Sibal said, adding that the Rajya Sabha chairman had to only ascertain whether the motion was in order. As the Congress hit out at Naidu, the BJP jumped to his defence and said the Rajya Sabha Chairman's office is not a post office meant to forward the applications it received but it has to apply its mind judiciously which he did. ""We thank him. He did not allow his office to be misused, "" BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said. She cited Naidu's order in which he referred to use of words like ""prime facie"" and ""may have been"" by opposition parties in their charges referring to the CJI to highlight that their allegations indicate a mere suspicion, a conjecture or an assumption against him. ""It was the grossest abuse of power of impeachment by the Congress,"" Lekhi said, terming it an act of blasphemy towards the Constitution. She accused the Congress of adopting ""intimidatory"" tactics towards the Supreme Court and said its move was not an attack on the individual but an institution as it wanted to create anarchy by making people ""lose"" faith in the judiciary. She claimed the Congress was trying to create an impression in the world that India was a banana republic, something it had turned the country into when it was in power, by ""disrupting institutions"", and added that its institutions were ""very strong"" and command reverence of people. The Congress is confusing rule of law with ""rules of dynasty"", she said. Earlier, Sibal said “never before in India's history” had a motion moved by MPs been dismissed at the preliminary stage as he attacked Naidu. ""It is our privilege to move the motion. You cannot boot the privilege in this manner,"" Sibal said, adding that the government is very keen that charges made in the petition must not be allowed to be inquired into. The order destroys the legitimate processes of the law. It seeks to ensure that no enquiry takes place, he added. The CJI would have nothing to do with their petition challenging the order, Sibal hoped. Congress media-in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala described the opposition's move as a fight between forces ""rejecting democracy"" and voices ""rescuing democracy"". Surjewala said within hours of 64 MPs submitting the impeachment notice, Leader of Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley had shown ""naked prejudice"" by calling it a revenge petition, ""virtually dictating the verdict"" to the Rajya Sabha chairman. Besides the Congress, MPs of the CPI, CPI(M), NCP, SP, BSP and the IUML were signatories to the notice. In Hyedrabad, where he was yesterday re-elected the general secretary of the CPI(M) for a fresh term, Yechury also slammed Naidu's decision. ""I am sorry to say that about the honourable Vice-President and Chairman of Rajya Sabha (Naidu), but I think that the methods, that had been very clearly laid down — both in the constitutional procedures and the rules — have not been followed,"" Yechury told  . He said the presiding officer of either House, in which the impeachment motion has been moved, does not have the discretion to independently decide about the validity of the motion. The motion needs to be referred to a three-member committee, which normally should include a Supreme Court judge, a high court chief justice and a jurist. Yechury said if that committee gives the findings, saying the impeachment motion is untenable, then the Chairman could have taken the decision. ""I can say this with a certain degree of experience, because... (of the impeachment notice) I moved against Justice Soumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court,"" the 65-year-old Left leader said. The Rajya Sabha had in 2011 passed an impeachment motion against Justice Sen. But, before the motion could be placed in the Lok Sabha, Sen resigned.",PTI,PTI

In July last year, the agency registered a case against Lalu Prasad, his family members and others under the provisions of the PMLA. Before this, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a criminal FIR and conducted multiple searches on the properties of Lalu Prasad and others.

"Three or four hours into counting for the Karnataka Assembly election on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appeared set to claim a majority, laying waste to predictions of a Congress win or a hung Assembly  . However, as the day wore on, it looked less and less likely that the BJP would be able to cross the halfway mark on its own. And in the end, the BJP was left with 104 seats, the Congress with 78 and the Janata Dal (Secular) with 38. The exit polls had largely got it right. The Congress and JD(S) quickly attempted to cobble together a post-poll alliance, much to the chagrin of the BJP. However, one man bore the brunt of the outcome more than the rest: Siddaramaiah, the now former chief minister. Two visuals best encapsulate his response to the humiliation heaped on him by his own party after it decided to offer the role of chief minister to the JD(S). First, there was the press conference. If it wasn't strange enough that Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee chief G Parameshwara addressed the media before the incumbent chief minister of the state, it was truly bizarre to see Siddaramaiah parroting the state unit chief's lines when it was his turn to speak. Then, there was the visit of Congress and JD(S) leaders to Raj Bhavan to meet Governor Vajubhai Vala. By this point, Siddaramaiah wore the look of a defeated and broken man. While Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge sat quietly next to HD Kumaraswamy, the JD(S) president and Congress' Ghulam Nabi Azad appeared to be involved in a deep discussion. Azad is seen reassuringly placing his hand on Kumaraswamy's arm, while the latter is ostensibly seeking his reassurances from the sheets of paper daintily balanced on the former's knee. Off to the side, Siddaramaiah is seen sitting by himself, lips pursed and arms crossed defiantly, eyes looking off into the distance, almost as if trying to make sense of how he could have fallen down the Congress pecking order so suddenly. Whether or not the Congress and JD(S) combine form the next government in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah has declared that this election was his last and he shall not be contesting again. If and how he gets his own back against the party that sidelined him so swiftly and mercilessly, remains to be seen.",FP Staff,FP Staff
" A protester, who was injured in the violence during the Maratha quota stir in adjoining Navi Mumbai, has succumbed to injuries at the government-run JJ Hospital here. Hospital Dean Dr Mukund Tayade told PTI that 25-year-old Rohan Todkar had sustained multiple injuries on his head, hands and legs during the violence at Kopar Khairane on Wednesday. He was shifted to JJ Hospital yesterday and was kept in the intensive care unit, but succumbed to his injuries yesterday, Tayade said. Around 20 policemen, including eight officers, were injured in stone-pelting by protesters at Kopar Khairane and Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday during the bandh called by Maratha organisations to demand quota for the community in government jobs and education. Over 150 vehicles, including 20 belonging to police, were damaged in the violence. Nine persons were injured when police caned protesters and fired pellets and rubber bullets on the violent mob, police had said. Police had fired 40 shotgun rounds, 22 rubber bullets, 42 teargas shells and 11 teargas grenades to disperse the violent mob in Navi Mumbai, an official had said. Internet services were suspended in Navi Mumbai as a precautionary measure yesterday. Marathas, a politically influential community that constitutes around 30% of the state’s population, have been demanding 16% reservation. The community had earlier taken out silent marches across the state to highlight their demands, prominent among them being that of reservation. Five MLAs have so far resigned over the Maratha quota demand. Bharat Bhalke (Congress), Rahul Aher (BJP) and Dattatraya Bharne (NCP) resigned as legislators today, Maharashtra Assembly sources said. Bhalke, who represents Pandharpur in Solapur district, said he was resigning to express solidarity with quota protests. Talking to PTI, Bhalke said he had visited the family of Maratha activist Kakasaheb Shinde, who committed suicide by jumping into the Godavari in Aurangabad district on July 23. “The sentiments of the Maratha youth are intense. There is lot of unrest over the lack of (job) opportunities. Promises made to them have not been fulfilled. I have decided to resign to express my solidarity with the Maratha quota protesters as well as in support of the demand for quota by the Dhangars and other deprived communities,” Bhalke said. “I am quitting membership of the assembly to highlight the unrest among the Marathas, Dhangars, Muslims and Mahadeo Koli communities,” he said. Bhalke said the Maharashtra government has stayed the previous Congress government’s decision to allot quota for Muslims even though the (Bombay) high court had not passed any adverse comment on the Muslim reservation. The high court in 2014 stayed implementation of the Congress-NCP government’s decision to provide reservation to Marathas. It also stayed the decision to provide five per cent reservation to the Muslims in government service, but allowed quotas for them in educational institutions. Aher, who represents Chandwad in Nashik district, announced in Nashik city that he was resigning as MLA. He handed over his resignation letter to Maratha Kranti Morcha activists who were fasting in protest outside the district collector’s office this afternoon. “Please treat this letter as my resignation. Whenever required, the Maratha community members could hand it over to Assembly Speaker,” he stated. Yesterday, Harshvardhan Jadhav (Shiv Sena) and Bhausaheb Patil Chikatgaonkar (NCP) from Aurangabad district had offered to resign in support of the quota demand. Jadhav, who represents Kannad assembly constituency, submitted his resignation letter to the office of the Assembly Speaker this morning. Chikatgaonkar (Vaijapur constituency) said he had e-mailed his resignation to the Speaker. Later today, Dattatraya Bharne, the NCP legislator from Indapur, also sent his resignation to the Speaker as well as to party leader Ajit Pawar. “Despite oral as well as written promises by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, no concrete decision on the reservation was taken to date which is a serious matter,” Bharne said. A Vidhan Bhavan official said an MLA who wished to resign was not required to specify the reason, but some of the MLAs who have quit have stated the reason – that they were quitting in support of the agitation. The resignation letter, which should be in a prescribed format, needs to be addressed to the Speaker, the official said. The agitation of the Maratha community for reservation in jobs and education turned violent yesterday as Maratha outfits called for a bandh in Mumbai and surrounding areas.

"By Tuesday afternoon, as it became clear the Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in more than a 100 seats across Karnataka, reports emerged that the Congress had approached JD(S) to form a post-poll alliance, which both parties were vehemently opposed to during the campaign. According to  senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad approached JD(S) chief HD Deve Gowda and reportedly offered the chief minister's post to Gowda's son, HD Kumaraswamy. This move echoes what happened in 2004, when the same two parties came together, to overtake BJP, which emerged as the largest party in the state. While Congress at that time led the alliance with N Dharam Singh at the chief minister, JD(S)' Siddaramaiah (at that time) was the deputy chief minister. However, it was HD Kumaraswamy who had led the coup against the Congress coalition in the state and broke the alliance in 2006, barely 20 months after Dharam Singh took over. As this  , the two parties decided to form the alliance two weeks after the results were announced. Here is a rundown of what happened in 2004 and how the coalition collapsed subsequently. It was the second time, since 1983, that the electorate had thrown up a hung Assembly in Karnataka. The results were declared on 12 May, 2004, where the   in the state with 79 seats, followed by the Congress at 65 seats and JD(S) with 58 seats. It was a surprise as in the 21 years prior to it, the state always  . The year 2004 was also the first time BJP had emerged as a major party in the south. However, denied a clear majority, it was up to Deve Gowda's JD(S) to side with either Congress or the saffron party. In the run-up to the 2004 polls, Gowda had firmly asserted that he would not support either the BJP or the Congress. In an interview with   he said, ""I am confident the JD(S) will form the government in Karnataka on its own. The party will maintain equidistance from both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party."" Nevertheless, he changed his mind in a matter of 15 days after the results were announced. For two weeks after the Assembly results were announced, Karnataka Congress Legislature Party leader, N Dharam Singh, held negotiations with Gowda in New Delhi, to enter an alliance and form a coalition government.

However, as much as JD(S) supremo Gowda expressed his disapproval of the BJP, his politically ambitious son Kumaraswamy had other plans. Kumaraswamy felt the Congress did not care about the JD(S) and did nothing to satisfy their demands. When Gowda installed Kumaraswamy as the JD(S) state president, his directive was to build the party and remove the Congress from the equation in the next election.

"The political drama in Karnataka doesn’t appear to be nearing an end anytime soon, with BJP’s BS Yeddyurappa swearing-in as the Chief Minister, even as the newly-formed Congress-JD(S) alliance called the governor’s invitation to the saffron party a ‘mockery of the constitution’. But with the Congress-JD(S) alliance attempting to pull a ‘BJP-esque’ move in Karnataka, several old tweets by the BJP have resurfaced on social media, mostly in stark contrast to what the party currently practices. After Arun Jaitley’s tweet from March 2017, where he had said that the governor would be ‘constitutionally right’ only if he invited the coalition formed by the majority of the elected MLAs to form government, an even older tweet from Narendra Modi has resurfaced on social media. In 2011, PM Modi had (very ironically) tweeted: Modi was talking about the then Karnataka Governor HR Bhardwaj, who had recommended President’s rule in the state after the then government (none too surprisingly a BJP government) had lost support in the assembly due to the charges levied against it, and was forced to prove majority. Modi, who was a senior leader in the opposition party then, had raised questions over the ‘constitutionality’ of the governor. Today, the Congress is raising the same questions, as the BJP has been granted a surplus of fifteen days by the governor to prove majority, when BS Yeddyurappa had only asked for seven days.

"United Progressive Alliance chairperson and former Congress President Sonia Gandhi hosted leaders of several Opposition parties at her residence in New Delhi on Tuesday evening,   reported. The meeting triggered speculation about the parties discussing strategy to unite against the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,   said.    Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s Kanimozhi, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh, Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Tejashwi Yadav, Hindustani Awam Morcha’s Jitan Ram Manjhi and Jammu and Kashmir National Conference’s Omar Abdullah were among those who attended the meeting.

"Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday, 7 April, slammed BJP chief Amit Shah's remarks that equated opposition parties with animals, saying that the ""disrespectful statement"" reflected his ""mentality"", and tore into the Modi rule, alleging there is a collapse of government. Gandhi said the saffron party chief and BJP-RSS considered that there were only two ""non-animals"" in the country – Shah and Modi – and that Dalits, tribals, minorities and even his own party leaders were ""worthless"". The Congress chief made an acerbic attack on Modi, saying: In an all-round attack on the Modi regime, he alleged there was a collapse in government due to complete financial mismanagement, demonetisation and implosion of the financial system. ""Nirav Modi is an example, Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi,  Piyush Goyal.... they are all examples,"" Gandhi said. On the fifth round of his visit to poll-bound Karnataka, Gandhi addressed rallies and roadside meetings in Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts and spoke to reporters. Taking a swipe at Shah, the Congress chief said it was the mentality that there were only two or three people in this country ""who are worth anything, who understand everything and everybody else is a worthless person"". ""It's not only Dalits, it's tribals, it's minorities. It doesn't stop there. It's Mr Advani, Mr Manohar Joshi, even Mr Gadkari, it's everybody,"" he said. ""The thing is that the BJP people internally don't have guts to say it to you. They say it to us,"" Gandhi said. At a rally in Mumbai to mark BJP's foundation day on Friday, Shah had equated opposition parties to 'snakes' and ‘mongoose' and 'dogs' and 'cats', who are seeking to unite despite their inherent differences to take on the BJP in next year's Lok Sabha polls. Shah later said what he meant was political parties having no ideological similarities were coming together out of fear of Modi. Continuing his attack, Gandhi said that what was happening to Dalits across the country was 'disgusting'. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

"NEW DELHI: In a major relief to the Centre, the Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed it to go ahead with reservation in promotion for employees belonging to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe category in “accordance with law”. The top court took into account the Centre’s submissions that entire process of promotion has come to a “standstill” due to the orders passed by various high courts and the apex court had also ordered for “status quo” in a similar matter in 2015. A vacation bench of justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and Ashok Bhushan said that the Centre was not “debarred” from making promotions in accordance with law in the matter. “It is made clear that the Union of India is not debarred from making promotions in accordance with law, subject to further orders, pending further consideration of the matter,” the bench said. The government said there were separate verdicts by the high courts of Delhi, Bombay and Punjab and Haryana on the issue of reservation in promotion to SC/ST employees and the apex court had also passed different orders on appeals filed against those judgement. “We will say you (Centre) can go ahead with promotion in accordance with law,” the bench told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh, representing the Centre. During the hearing, the ASG cited the case laws on the issue of quota in promotion in government jobs and stated that the apex court’s 2006 judgement in M. Nagaraj case would be applicable. The Nagaraj verdict had said that creamy layer concept cannot be applied to the SCs/STs for promotions in government jobs like two earlier verdicts of 1992 Indra Sawhney and others versus Union of India (popularly called Mandal Commission verdict) and 2005 E.V Chinnaiah versus State of Andhra Pradesh, which dealt with creamy layer in Other Backward Classes category. Singh said the petition before the bench was the Centre’s challenge to the Delhi high court’s August 23 last year verdict quashing government’s order extending reservation in promotion to employees belonging to the SCs/STs beyond five years from November 16, 1992. At the outset, the ASG referred to orders passed by the apex court earlier, including a reference made to a five-judge constitution bench, and contended that one of the orders says there would be “status quo” as far as reservation in promotion to SC/SC employees was concerned. He referred to a May 17 order passed by a bench headed by Justice Kurian Joseph in a similar matter in which it was said that pendency of petition before it shall not stand in the way of the Centre taking steps for the purpose of promotion. “How is the promotion taking place as of now,” the bench asked. Responding to the query, the ASG said, “They are not. It is all (at a ) standstill. This is the problem.” “I am the government and I want to give promotion as per constitutional mandate,” he told the bench and urged that he was seeking a similar order as passed on May 17. He said that another bench of the apex court had earlier said that a five-judge constitution bench would examine the issue as to whether the Nagaraj judgement, which dealt with the issue of application of the ‘creamy layer’ for reservation to SC and ST categories in promotion in government jobs, was required to be re-looked at or not. He also referred to Article 16 (4A) of the Constitution, which enables state to provide for reservation in matters of promotion to SC/ST which in its opinion were not adequately represented in the services. “That is the enabling provision,” the bench observed. It said that according to Article 16 (4A), state would have to make out a case for providing reservation in promotion to SC/ST based on quantifiable data. The provision also says that the data should be based on factors like backwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall efficiency. The bench has tagged the Centre’s appeal with pending matters. On November 15 last year, a three-judge bench of the apex court had agreed to consider whether its 11-year-old judgement in the Nagaraj case was needed to be re-visited. The top court had referred the matter to a constitution bench while it was hearing a batch of petition which arose from a Bombay high court verdict quashing two state government notifications terming them as ultra vires to Article 16(4A) of the Constitution. The Delhi high court, in its August 23, 2017 verdict, had set aside an August 1997 office memorandum issued by the Department of Personnel and Training on the issue of reservation in promotion to the employees belonging to SC/ST. The high court had also restrained the Centre from granting reservation in promotion without first collecting the data on inadequate representation. The nine-judge bench of Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney case in 1992, permitted reservation for the SCs and STs in promotion to continue for a period of five years from November 16, 1992.",PTI,PTI
"A day after BJP president Amit Shah called on Uddhav Thackeray in an attempt to placate the sulking ally, the Shiv Sena chief today said whatever is happening is ""all drama"". Addressing party cadres at Palghar near Mumbai, where Sena candidate lost to BJP's nominee in the recent Lok Sabha by-election, Thackeray referred to the meeting on Wednesday and said, ""Whatever is going on now is all drama"". Shrinivas Wanaga, Sena's candidate who lost, gave a ""scare"" to the BJP, Thackeray claimed. After the BJP sources on Wednesday termed the Shah-Thackeray meeting as ""positive"" and claimed it reduced the tension between the allies, Sena leader Sanjay Raut earlier on Thursday sought to dismiss ""speculation"" that the talks would culminate in an alliance for the next Lok Sabha polls. Thackeray continued to attack the BJP, accusing it of using ""all possible means"" to win the by-poll. ""A minimum of six lakh votes were cast against the BJP. I am not ready to accept the defeat, be it in a sporting way or any other way,"" he said. ""If the Electronic Voting Machines malfunctioned due to heat, then what did they conduct (prior) tests on? Voters' names were missing, there was bogus voting, machines malfunctioned, people were caught distributing cash. Is this called democracy?"" Thackeray asked. ""There was no action even when the BJP used all possible means. It is, in a way, a defeat of the BJP,"" he said. ""One tribal boy (Shrinivas Wanaga) managed to get two and a half lakh votes in fifteen days (of campaigning). Now there are eight months left. In 2019, Shrinivas Wanaga should become the MP"", he said Meanwhile, Maharashtra Swabhimani Paksha chief Narayan Rane on Thursday targeted the Shiv Sena and dared the Uddhav Thackeray-headed party to walk out of the BJP-led NDA government in the state as it announced its decision to contest elections on its own. ""You talk about fighting polls without an alliance (with the BJP). Then why do you not let go of power? You criticise your ally while being part of the government. Contesting elections separately does not befit the Sena,"" Rane said, addressing his party workers in suburban Bandra. Rane, a Rajya Sabha member, said there were various challenges plaguing the state but no political party seemed interested in tackling them, hence, he had to form his own political party. The former chief minister of Maharashtra further questioned if the Sena was formed for the welfare of Marathi-speaking individuals, why did the percentage of such people decrease in Mumbai. ""Marathi people gave everything to the Sena but what did the party give back to them?"" he questioned. ""If the entire responsibility of governance is on the BJP, are you just there to sit and eat? he asked.  Slamming the Congress, Rane said the party did not fulfil the promises it had made to the people. In an apparent dig at former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, who was earlier a Union minister, Rane said the reins of the state were given to a person who knew nothing about the state. ""I left the Congress because they kept making promises to me. After I quit the party, I had offers from parties including the Sena. However, I realised I had to form my own party if I wanted to give justice to my (party) workers,"" Rane said as he exhorted his workers to start preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha election.",FP Staff,PTI
" Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan Saturday slammed BJP president Amit Shah for his remarks on the Sabarimala women entry issue, saying it was an ""attack"" on the Supreme Court, Constitution and the country's judicial system. The chief minister was reacting to the BJP chief's attack against his government over implementation of the apex court verdict allowing entry of women of all age groups into the Sabarimala temple. ""Shah's assertion that courts must only pronounce verdicts which can be carried out, conveys the message that fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution are not meant to be implemented,"" Vijayan said. Speaking at Kannur after inaugurating the BJP's district office, Shah had also warned that BJP workers would not hesitate to pull down the state government if it continues to ""suppress"" the agitation of Ayyappa devotees. Shah, who threatened to oust the LDF government, must remember that the government did not come to power at the mercy of BJP, but with the support of the people of the state, Vijayan said. ""It must also be noted that the BJP leader dared to threaten a democratically elected government because it stood by the Supreme Court verdict and its commitment to protect fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution,"" he said. ""Shah's statement also reveals the true colour of RSS and Sangh Parivar,"" he said. The BJP chief's argument that gender equality must not be implemented through temple entry laws is a precursor to the arguments that caste based discrimination must not be abolished by law, Vijayan said. ""His ramblings also reveal their indebtedness to the obsolete views of gender equality propounded by Manusmriti,"" he said. ""Civil society, which upholds fundamental rights including gender equality, must rise against these uncivilised ideologies,"" Vijayan added.",Press Trust of India,PTI

"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has roped in some renowned foreign economists in the newly-constituted economic advisory panel to provide the best possible professional advice to his cash-strapped government on prudent economic policies, media reported on Sunday, 2 September. The immediate challenge for the Khan-led government is to arrange finances to fill about a USD 10 billion gap that is arising due to higher outflows than estimated inflows. Pakistan's current account deficit stands at USD 18 billion, while its foreign currency reserves are just over USD 10 billion, enough to cover two months of imports, according to figures released before the cricketer-turned-politician was sworn-in as prime minister. Unlike past practices, the new 18-member Economic Advisory Council (EAC) will be headed by the prime minister himself to ensure that the best possible professional advice is available to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led government to inform, optimise and synergise the formulation and implementation of its economic and financial policies. The first meeting of the council will be convened soon, Dawn newspaper reported. In the past, EACs were headed by finance ministers with no definite agenda for regular meetings. It was observed that EAC met even once in four months and its advice was not considered seriously. Consequently, EACs have become mere debating forums, the report said. According to the terms of reference, the ministry of finance will be the nodal government agency for the EAC, which will function in an entirely non-partisan manner and is expected to strengthen existing state institutions in a collaborative and concerted manner. Out of the EAC's 18 members, seven belong to government and 11 are from the private sector. From the private sector, three leading international academics made EAC members are Atif R Mian of Princeton University (Department of Member Economics) and Woodrow Wilson (School of Public Policy), Asim ljaz Khawaja, Sumitomo-FASID Professor of Member International Finance and Development at the Harvard Kennedy School, and lmran Rasul, Professor of Economics, Department of Member Economics, University College, London.

Sakshi Maharaj is known for his controversial remarks, including when he asked Hindu women to have at least four children, sparking condemnation from the Opposition, which alleged that the ruling party was trying to polarise the society. He had also stoked a row by describing Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse as a “patriot” and was forced to apologise in Parliament. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" Amid charges that most police encounters in Uttar Pradesh were ""fake"", Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday accused the BJP government of misusing the police. ""The BJP is misusing the Uttar Pradesh police, which is inflicting torture on the people of the state and creating fear among them. The Samajwadi Party is not only raising questions, but also telling other Opposition parties that the government is continuously engaged in fake encounters,"" the SP chief told reporters in Lucknow. He demanded that the government should at least provide a list of criminals carrying reward on their head to substantiate its claim that those killed by the police were highly notorious, he said. Yadav demanded Rs 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of Narendra Gujjar, against whom, he said, a ""fake cow slaughter case"" was registered, and claimed that Gujjar was tortured to death in custody by the police in Meerut. ""It is the duty of the government to see that everyone gets justice. Has the situation worsened to that extent where no one can plead for justice? Will the BJP now deprive the people of the state of justice?"" he posed. As many as 50 dreaded criminals have been killed in over 1,400 encounters in the past over one year in the state, while 3,435 history-sheeters were put behind bars following encounters. Yadav also referred to the death of the father of Unnao rape survivor in police custody. ""The BJP says that we used to give Rs 50 lakh compensation when a Muslim died. Today, when a Hindu has died, why are you (the BJP) is not helping the Hindu. We do not believe in taking advantage by creating rift between Hindus and Muslims. This is just a diversionary tactics,"" the SP leader said. He also blamed the UP police for the unrest in Aligarh Muslim University. ""If the government had wanted, then the situation would not have worsened,"" Akhilesh said. On reports of CBI probe into sale of sugar mills during Mayawati regime, he said the investigation was being done keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in mind. Attacking the BJP in the context of Kairana and Noorpur bypolls, he said, ""These people have been saying that if other parties win the bypolls, then Diwali will be celebrated in Pakistan. I never went to Pakistan, nor do I have a Pakistani visa. The BJP should tell who went to Pakistan discreetly."" Yadav contested the government's claim that it was taking care of sugarcane growers in the state. He also demanded that the government should provide Rs 10 lakh assistance to families of Sitapur dog-bite victims. A total of 12 children have fallen prey to dog attacks so far. Referring to the investors' summit in UP and the follow up visit to the US by senior UP minister Sidharthnath Singh, the former chief minister said, ""The companies with which the UP government has inked MoUs, do not have any balance sheet. The proposed defence corridor is a work to divert the attention of the people. This government will never be able to build the Jewar airport or the defence corridor."" He attacked Singh, who is UP health minister, saying that people in the US know about the health scenario of the state. The ambulances must be repaired first, he said. Yadav also accused the UP government of stalling the proposed mango wholesale market in Malihabad and perfumery park and museum in Kannauj. ""We want to know the quantum of investment in UP during the four years of Narendra Modi government,"" he said. Taking a jibe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, ""The UP CM is not bothered about improving the law and order in UP. He is more bothered about the law and order of Karnataka (where he was campaigning for the Assembly elections)."" When his attention was drawn to reports on Congress president Rahul Gandhi's ambition to become the prime minister, Yadav said, ""These are post-poll matters.

" The BJP may have wrested an extra seat in the recent   but the victory will backfire on the saffron party as its ""anti-Dalit face stood exposed"" while the SP-BSP unity got strengthened, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav claimed on Sunday. In an interview to  , Akhilesh Yadav also said his wife Dimple Yadav may not contest the next Lok Sabha elections to blunt the nepotism charge that political opponents hurl at Samajwadi Party (SP), which he leads. Dimple Yadav is currently the Lok Sabha MP from Kannauj. The SP chief also alleged that law and order had collapsed during the present dispensation in UP while ""political encounters"" were being staged. Those involved will have to face a probe sooner or later, he warned. The SP will exploit to the hilt ""the BJP's conspiracy against a Dalit"" during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Sunday. He was referring to BJP nominee Anil Agrawal edging out BSP's Bhimrao Ambedkar in a nail-biting contest earlier this week. ""The victory of the BJP on the ninth seat, contested by the saffron party with the help of money power, has given the SP an opportunity to expose the communal outfit's anti-Dalit face. Because of the conspiracy hatched by the BJP against a Dalit getting elected, SP-BSP unity has got strengthened all the more for the (2019) Lok Sabha polls,"" Akhilesh Yadav alleged. The real character of the BJP, which ""misused money and power against the poor"", stood exposed in the recent Rajya Sabha polls, he claimed. The SP chief, who cancelled a function to felicitate party leader Jaya Bachchan on getting re-elected to the Rajya Sabha, felt the defeat of the Dalit candidate would cement his party's relations with Mayawati-led BSP. Terming the victory of SP candidates in Lok Sabha by-polls in seats earlier held by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya as a ""big"" achievement, Akhilesh Yadav claimed a message had gone across the country that the BJP can be defeated in 2019. ""I term the victories in by-polls as big ones because it was not just our victory but also the defeat of the chief minister and the deputy chief minister. Yogi ji, who was campaigning all over the country for the BJP could not save his own turf. It has sent a message all over the country and instilled confidence among people and workers that if the BJP can be defeated in their (leaders') constituencies, the result can be replicated all over,"" he said. I thank   ji for her support, he added. The BJP lost the by-polls in Gorakhpur, the bastion of the chief minister, and Phulpur, earlier held by the deputy chief minister. Asked about his party's strategy for the 2019 polls, Akhilesh Yadav said besides booth management, party workers have been asked to reach all villages and interact with people. ""I, our leaders and our cadre will go everywhere. We will apprise the people of the works initiated during my regime and ask them to compare them with what is going on in the BJP regime. The BJP had made a number of promises but fulfilled none. The anger of people is palpable and they have shown it in the by-polls,"" he said. On the BJP's argument that voting percentage in the Lok Sabha by-polls was less, Akhilesh Yadav said, ""Had more voters come out, our victory margin would have been bigger. They (BJP) misled people and won elections and then they could not follow what they promised."" The SP chief also announced his wife Dimple Yadav will not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. ""We have decided, she will not contest this time as we are charged with ' ' (nepotism). BJP leaders like Rajnath Singh, Kalyan Singh, Raman Singh, Shivraj Chauhan are indulging in nepotism. Members of their family are in politics. My wife is not contesting...They (BJP) too should also set an example. If they don't do so and only make allegations against us, I can also change my mind,"" he said. Asked about a future alliance with the Congress, he said the picture will become clear when polls come near. ""My relations with the Congress are good and will remain so. It is a national party while we are strong here in the state. The preparations for stitching together an alliance are on. The leader will be decided later at an opportune time,"" the SP chief said. On how his father Mulayam Singh Yadav felt after Lok Sabha bypoll victories, Akhilesh Yadav said, ""He was very happy that youths were elected. He blessed us all."" Akhilesh Yadav attacked Yogi Adityanath's statement that ""he did not celebrate Eid"" and said, ""I myself celebrate all festivals and observe nine-day fast during Navratri. My wife (Dimple) remains on fast on Thursdays,"" he said. The former UP chief minister alleged law and order had collapsed under the BJP regime. ""They are doing encounters. But these are political encounters. And I want to tell all those involved that they will have to face probe now or later. They cannot get away with it. The BJP is damaging the fabric of the society by spreading communalism and casteism,"" he remarked.

In that meeting, the home minister had directed that all necessary measures be taken in consultation with other agencies to suitably strengthen security arrangements for the prime minister. Maoist-hit states like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal were termed as sensitive by the home ministry and the police chiefs of these states were told to be extra careful when the prime minister visits their states, the official said.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, 31 October mocked Congress president Rahul Gandhi, saying he keeps repeating things like a stuck gramophone but people would not accept his ""childish"" claims and ""lies"" against the government as they make ""fun"" of such remarks. With campaign for assembly elections in five states underway and the Lok Sabha polls less than six months away, he stressed on his development plank during a video interaction with BJP workers, asking them to go to people with a three-point agenda – development, fast development and development for all. To a question from a worker as to how they should respond to opposition leaders' ""abuses"" like calling him a scorpion – an apparent reference to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's recent remarks, Modi said they were offering him what they had. He was glad, the prime minister said, that he was of any use to them as it allows them to vent their anger and spend their time ""happily"" with their family members in evening. Modi, however, made fun of Gandhi when a party worker asked him as to how they should respond to the Congress president's comments in his rallies that there should be mobile manufacturing factories in the areas he visits. These people don't know that time has changed and they should not treat people as fools, Modi said, adding that nobody accepts such childish remarks. People make fun of it, he said. Modi also targeted Gandhi without naming him over his recent criticism of the central government on the issue of OROP (One Rank One Pension) for ex-servicemen. Since his government has implemented it so his rivals were concerned over ex-servicemen's ""love"" for him and repeating ""lies after lies"", he said. Modi claimed that ""lies"" of Congress leaders against the BJP and its governments on certain issues indicated his dispensation's success as he referred to his ""digital India"" campaign which, he added, had made lives easier for crores of people by letting them avail of government benefits sitting at home.

He asked BJP workers in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan to inform the masses about the development works the party's government had done in these states and also told them to remind the people about the poor governance when the opposition was in power. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the two states where the BJP has been in power for 15 years, are no longer ""bimaru"" (sick) states, he said, adding that all the three states have reached new heights of development under the party's rule. He also asked the party's workers to run a campaign asking people to donate anywhere between Rs 5 and Rs 1,000 to the BJP through the Narendra Modi app. Modi described the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, which he had inaugurated in Gujarat earlier in the day, as a work that will make coming generations proud.

"The Union cabinet yesterday gave its nod to a Bill which seeks to set up DNA data banks across India to store profiles and also provides for a jail term of up to three years to those who leak the information stored in such facilities. The Bill also states that all DNA data, including DNA profiles, DNA samples and records, will only be used for identification of the person and not for “any other purpose,” official sources said. It will be introduced in parliament during the Monsoon Session beginning July 18, they said. The Bill, based on the one prepared by the Law Commission recently, says that national and regional DNA data banks will be set up for maintaining a national database for identification of victims, suspects in cases, undertrials, missing persons and unidentified human remains. According to it, those leaking the DNA profile information to people or entities who are not entitled to have it, will be punished with a jail term of up to three years and a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh. Similar, punishment has also been provided for those who seek the information on DNA profiles illegally. The government had recently informed the Supreme Court that the bill for DNA profiling to enable maintenance of records of unidentified and unclaimed bodies or missing persons, is likely to be brought in the upcoming session of Parliament. A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud considered the statement made by additional solicitor general Pinky Anand, appearing for the Centre, saying the government should take steps “as expeditiously as possible”. The court was hearing a PIL stating that India did not have a national DNA database to address the issue of thousands of unclaimed bodies that are reported annually. It had suggested maintaining of DNA profiles of the bodies before their disposal which could help in their identification by the family members. “The primary intended purpose for enactment of the DNA-Based Technology (Use and Regulation) Bill, 2018 is for expanding the application of DNA-based forensic technologies to support and strengthen the justice delivery system of the country,” an official statement said. The Bill’s provisions will enable the cross-matching between persons who have been reported missing on the one hand and unidentified dead bodies found in various parts of the country on the other, and also for establishing the identity of victims in mass disasters, it said.",PTI,Scroll Staff

"As protests across Chennai came to a head over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit, the police on Thursday detained several protesters in the city’s Saidapet locality, where they were raising slogans of ‘Go Back Modi’. MDMK Chief Vaiko was among the several protesters who were detained in the city. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in the city to inaugurate the Defence Expo 2018 in Mahabalipuram near Chennai.

He had also written messages condemning the PM’s visit on the walls of his house. Meanwhile, some protesters climbed atop billboards outside the Chennai airport to raise slogans against the Prime Minister. DMK working president MK Stalin had earlier asked people to hoist black flags atop their houses during Modi's visit to Tamil Nadu to lodge their protest against the Centre's ""inaction"" on the Cauvery issue. Party honcho Karunanidhi was also seen at his residence, sporting a black t-shirt in support of the protests that have fanned across the city. Members from the opposition parties and fringe groups will also gather at various points in the city while carrying black flags, including IIT Madras and the Cancer Institute, where the PM will be inaugurating other projects.

 : The Supreme Court will tomorrow hear a fresh plea from Karti Chidambaram, son of former Union minister P. Chidambaram, seeking quashing of the Enforcement Directorate’s   against him in the INX Media case. In his fresh writ petition, Karti Chidambaram has challenged the summons on the ground that the ED has no jurisdiction to issue such notices based on the FIR lodged by the CBI. The plea was mentioned today by his counsel before a bench comprising chief justice Dipak Misra and justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud, which agreed to hear it along with related pending matters scheduled for hearing tomorrow. The apex court is likely to hear tomorrow the anticipatory bail plea of Karti Chidambaram, who is presently in CBI custody in the case. The top court had earlier refused to stay the summons issued by the ED, saying he could make a request in this regard to the competent authority. It had posted the matter for hearing today after senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Karti Chidambaram, had sought time to file a proper application to challenge the ED proceedings. An FIR, filed on May 15 last year, had alleged irregularities in the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to INX Media for receiving overseas funds to the tune of Rs 305 crore in 2007 when P. Chidambaram was union finance minister. The apex court was hearing pleas, including the CBI’s appeal, challenging the Madras high court order staying a lookout circular (LOC) issued against Karti Chidambaram. The CBI had on September 1 last year said there were “good, cogent” reasons for issuing the LOC. The Chidambarams, however, have denied all the charges made against them. Earlier, a single judge bench of the Madras HC had stayed the LOC issued against Karti Chidambaram and others in the graft case. Later, the apex court considered the CBI appeal and stayed the operation of the high court order staying the LOC.

" In politically significant remarks, the ruling AIADMK on Sunday said that signs of its working together with BJP like a ""double-barrelled gun"" in the political arena were visible and ""no one can sever ties"" between the two parties. Coming out strongly against the principal opposition DMK-led persistent protests over the Cauvery imbroglio, the AIADMK said ""whatever be the number of protests and demonstrations, no one can sever the ties between the AIADMK and the BJP."" No one can weaken the bond between ""the Central and the state governments"" either, the AIADMK said in its Tamil mouthpiece ""Namadhu Puratchi Thalaivi Amma."" The state's ruling party said the protests by the DMK, its allies and friendly parties on the Cauvery issue were only aimed at spoiling the warmth between it and the BJP. ""The signs are (increasingly) becoming visible for the AIADMK and the BJP to work like a double-barrelled gun in Indian politics. The pathway is clear,"" the daily said, while emphasising upon the need for the leadership of the two parties to chart out a roadmap for the purpose. ""A roadmap for it should be thrashed out by the high commands of both the parties. That is the need of the hour,"" the AIADMK mouthpiece added. ""The state and the Central regimes led by the AIADMK and the BJP respectively are working responsibly and are headed towards a final resolution of the issue,"" the daily said, referring to the Cauvery issue. Under such circumstances, the AIADMK said, the main opposition DMK was holding ""unnecessary protests"" as it was ""apprehensive"" that the State and the Central governments, working in cohesion, would succeed in resolving the Cauvery issue. Mocking the DMK for holding protests which did not enjoy the ""people's support,"" the AIADMK hit out at its arch rival for trying to get an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi now on the issue after attempting to show black flags to him recently. Asking if it was an act of ""political civility,"" the AIADMK mouthpiece said no other party could indulge in such politics burying its self-respect. The AIADMK said its government allowed protests like black flag demonstrations keeping democratic ethos in mind. The daily, however, asked if the protesters succeeded in showing even a single black flag to Prime Minister Modi. It may be recalled that the AIADMK top leadership has been maintaining that a friendly relationship with the Centre was imperative for the progress of the state through proper financial sanctions and support. The DMK, however, has been unrelenting in its attack saying the ruling party was ""subservient,"" to the Centre. Notably, the AIADMK's assertion comes days after asking the Centre to change its mindset over the Cauvery issue. On 13 April, the party's mouthpiece had said, ""Without waiting anymore, it will be good if the Central government changed its mindset and avoided partiality."" If this was not done, ""it will lead to cracks in the unity and integration"" (of the nation), it had cautioned. The AIADMK's assertion assumes significance amid the persistent protests on the Cauvery issue. The DMK-led Opposition and the pro-Tamil outfits have been holding back-to-back protests including the recent anti-IPL stir on the river water issue and a massive human chain demonstration (by DMK and its allies) has been announced across the state tomorrow. The ruling party, after holding a day-long fast across Tamil Nadu on the issue earlier this month, has announced rallies between April 25 and 29 in the delta region to press the Centre to implement the Supreme Court verdict on the matter. Following the 16 February Supreme Court verdict, Tamil Nadu has been insisting that the court's order to the Centre to formulate a ""scheme"" referred to the setting up of the CMB and the Cauvery Water Regulatory Committee (CWRC).

"Opposition leaders launched a scathing attack on BJP leader Arjun Ram Meghwal, a day after the Union minister linked the rise in the number of lynching incidents with Modi's popularity while claiming a conspiracy to defame the BJP and the prime minister. Meghwal's comments came after a 28-year-old man was beaten to death by a group of villagers in   on Saturday. Akbar Khan and his friend were reportedly walking with two cows in Lalawandi village on Friday night when a group of villagers thrashed him to death.

After hearing the concerned parties, justice Saumitra Dayal Singh dismissed the revision petition filed by Talat Aziz, a Samajwadi Party leader. In the petition it was alleged that a meeting was held by Aziz in Mahrajganj on February 10, 1999 and Adityanath’s arrival at the venue led to clashes.

" Slamming Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa over his remarks that Congress president Rahul Gandhi had consumed meat before visiting a temple, Shiv Sena on Thursday said that discussing such issues during poll campaign shows the ""sick mentality"" of the ""nervous"" BJP. Three days back, Yeddyurappa had hit out at Rahul Gandhi for reportedly visiting a temple after eating ""Javari chicken"" during his tour of northern parts of the poll-bound state. ""Congress president Rahul Gandhi gave the BJP family sleepless nights in Gujarat. It looks as if the same is going to be repeated in the Karnataka (Assembly elections). Rahul Gandhi visited a number of temples in Gujarat and offered prayers there. That time, the BJP criticised him severely, as it was worried about its own existence thinking what will happen if the Congress leader adopted Hindutva,"" the Sena, in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana said. Gandhi, during his election, had stopped at Kanakagiri in Koppal district and visited the Kanakachala Laxmi-Narasimha temple. The write-up also claimed that the Congress will corner the BJP in the upcoming Karnataka elections, similar to what they did last year ahead of the Gujarat polls by adopting ""soft Hindutva"". ""Now, election rallies are being held in Karnataka and there is an exchange of allegations between the BJP and the Congress. Like in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi has been visiting mosques as well as temples in that state. This has angered the BJP's chief ministerial face, B S Yeddyurappa, who accused Gandhi of visiting a temple after consuming meat,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said. And though the Congress immediately issued a clarification saying that Rahul Gandhi had a vegetarian meal before visiting the temple, according to Shiv Sena, the whole incident only shows the new ""low"" that this election campaign has touched. ""Discussing such issues during the election campaign is a sign of sick mentality,"" the Sena noted. The piece further read that one should not hurt people's religious sentiments, and also should not see what others were eating. ""Every religious place has its own customs and traditions. There are temples in Maharashtra where meat is offered to the deity...Raking up such issues in election campaigns displays a sick mentality. Only they know what was there in Rahul Gandhi's plate. But we are sure that it has turned the BJP nervous,"" the party added. The Sena said that instead of thinking about whether former prime minister Indira Gandhi was a vegetarian or not, it was important to note that she divided Pakistan.

" The Congress plans to go in for a broad based alliance in the Telangana Assembly polls in line with its efforts to forge opposition unity at the national level, a senior party leader has said. The party was trying to unite the opposition in the state and was in contact with all parties, including CPI, Kondaram (of TJS) and TDP, AICC in charge of Congress affairs in Telangana RC Khuntia said. ""We are not averse to having an alliance with TDP,"" he told  . Citing the example of Karnataka, where Congress allowed JD(S) to take the chief minister's post despite having more number of seats,he said the idea in Telangana was in line with it's efforts at the national level to unite the opposition. The proposal was however at a preliminary stage and seat-sharing had not yet been discussed, Khuntia said. ""This is only the preliminary stage. We have not discussed seat sharing. But we are formulating a broad-based alliance, including the TDP also, on the basis of the Common Minimum Programme,"" he said. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy has already urged all political parties, including TDP and non-political forces, to join hands with Congress to 'end the misrule' of TRS in the state. ""There can only be TRS and anti-TRS blocks (other BJP) in the state,"" Khuntia claimed. On how Congress would justify an alliance with TDP,which has always been opposed to it, he said Congress does not harbour any bitter feelings towards the TDP. He said the TDP opposed the NDA government, as seen in the no-confidence motion, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman election and the 'Bharat Bandh' against the fuel price hike, he said. The Congress aimed at defeating the 'communal forces' and wanted to take along opposition parties, he said. The party would highlight the 'failure' of TRS to implement its promises, including increase in reservations for minorities and STs and double bedroom housing for the poor, with emphasis on the door-to-door campaign, he said.

"Congress' master strategist and Vokkaliga strongman are just some of the phrases that were   Doddalahalli Kempegowda Shivakumar,   as BJP's BS Yeddyurappa announced his resignation as chief minister on Saturday, a mere 55 hours after he took oath of office. The next day, several media reports touted DK Shivakumar — DK or DKS as he is known within the Karnataka political circle — as  , the  ,   and the  . He has   his chief ministerial aspirations since a long time, and   he is unlikely to be placated with a ministerial or deputy chief minister's post in a government headed by JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy. With more than 30 years of political experience, Shivakumar was responsible for ensuring all Congress MLAs remained together to ensure a victory for the party in the scenario of a trust vote. He also ferried them to and from Hyderabad where all the 78 elected MLAs were holed up in a resort. Hailing from an agricultural family in Kanakapura, the senior Congress leader made his foray into politics during his college days in Bengaluru, when he landed a leadership role in the Youth Congress, according to  Shivakumar was the Karnataka State Youth Congress general secretary between 1983 and 1985. He made his political debut as a legislator when he was elected to the Zilla Panchayat in 1987. During the 1989 elections, Shivakumar won his first Assembly election as an independent candidate from Sathnur Assembly constituency in Kanakapura taluk,  , and came to be known as the ' '. In 1990, he was appointed junior minister for prisons and homeguards when S Bangarappa became Karnataka chief minister. Even though the portfolio was insignificant, Shivakumar was noticed for his leadership skills and hard work at the age of 29. When fellow Vokkaliga SM Krishna became chief minister in 1999, Shivakumar was made urban development minister. However, in the Congress-JD(S) alliance in 2004, Shivakumar was kept out of the ranks. When Siddaramaiah came to power in 2013, he too kept his distance from the Congress leader. Shivakumar was eventually made power minister in January 2014. This seven-time MLA first went up against veteran politician HD Deve Gowda in Sathnur at the age of 25, and lost by a thin margin. His rivalry with the Gowda family began that time and sustained over the years. In the 2002 Lok Sabha bypolls, Shivakumar lost to Deve Gowda but rose to fame again in the 2004 Lok Sabha general election, when he fielded newbie television journalist-turned-politician Tejaswini Sriramesh against the JD(S) supremo in Kanakapura,  . She won the polls by a landslide and cemented the trust of the Congress leadership in Delhi. The Congress leader's income and assets have nearly tripled since the 2013 Assembly elections, when he had declared assets valued at Rs 251 crore. Through the affidavit, Shivakumar declared cash and bank deposits worth Rs 95 crore, immovable assets including commercial buildings and land valued at over Rs 635.8 crore and gold, diamonds, and silver valued at over Rs 1.5 crore, among other assets. According to  Shivakumar has   pending against him related to forgery, corruption, destruction of evidence, criminal conspiracy, etc. In 2017, the Income Tax department raided 64 locations connected to him in a tax evasion case, which reportedly unearthed crores of undeclared income. This   for the Congress. In June 2002, Vilasrao Deshmukh sent his MLAs to Mysuru amidst a political crisis in Maharashtra. Around 71 MLAs from Congress, NCP and a few Independents scuttled to a resort in Mysuru. It was Shivakumar who transported all of them back to Mumbai for the trust vote and ensured they cleared it. Most recently, in August 2017, Shivakumar hosted Congress president Sonia Gandhi's close aide Ahmed Patel, at the Eagleton resort in Bengaluru. Patel was seeking re-election to Rajya Sabha. However, after a number of Congress MLAs defected to BJP, the party shepherded 44 of its MLAs to the resort, to prevent further possibility of horse-trading. This was just a week after he was embroiled in Income Tax raids against him.

The Congress, which has launched a tirade against the government over the Rafale deal that Prime Minister Narendra Modi struck during his visit to France in April 2015, however, said that the issue would not be raised during the meeting. ""The Congress party will not discuss India's defence deal with the head of state of a foreign country. This is our internal matter and this discussion the government has to do with France and not the Congress. ""We are demanding answers from our government and not from the French government,"" Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said. Alluding to the Rafale deal, he said that when one goes to buy something, the buyer has to ensure whether the product is good or not, as the seller will obviously say his product is good. The buyer has to decide looking at his pocket, Surjewala said. ""The government has to ensure that its money is not wasted and gets the best deal in the least money. There should be no loss to the state exchequer. ""It is not the responsibility of Macron, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the defence minister, on which they have failed,"" he alleged.

"The Supreme Court's decision of slashing the 15-day window given to Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa to prove majority showed that Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala had favoured the saffron party and he was at fault, the Shiv Sena said on Saturday. It also alleged that since the BJP has ""money and muscle power"", it may win over some Congress and JD(S) MLAs to prove majority in the southern state. ""The Karnataka power play reached the corridors of the Supreme Court, which virtually nullified the governor's decision.

""But the SC reduced the 15-day window and ordered it to be done within 24 hours. This shows that the governor had granted extra favours to Yeddyurappa.

This nomination is done based on the advice of the chief minister. But in this case, Yeddyurappa was yet to prove majority in the House. Therefore, by staying the nomination, the SC once again showed that the governor's move was wrong, it said. ""The BJP has 104 MLAs, but it does not have the answer as to how it is going to prove majority in the House. If at all there is an answer, it is either hidden in the money bags or lies with the Enforcement Directorate or the CBI. The responsibility of proving the majority seems to be more on the police, CBI and ED than Yeddyurappa,"" it said. ""Congress's four MLAs have gone missing, while the mining mafia in politics has become active once again. Perhaps because of them, Yeddyurappa is confidently saying that the BJP will win the trust vote,"" the Sena added. ""The letter presented before the Supreme Court, which Yeddyurappa had earlier submitted to the governor, says that some JD(S) MLAs will support him. This letter itself is a proof of horse-trading,"" it said. ""The Supreme Court has given a jolt to the BJP in Karnataka.

" Asserting that the BJP will break the ""myth"" that it cannot return to power at the Centre, its president Amit Shah said on Monday that the party will emerge stronger in the 2019 polls compared to the last general election. At a meeting of party's national office-bearers, state presidents and other key leaders from states, Shah set the tone for the next Parliamentary election and described the proposed alliance of Opposition parties against the BJP as a matter of happiness, saying it underlined his party's strength. Party spokespersons Sudhanshu Trivedi and Shahnawaz Hussain briefed reporters on Shah's speech, which Hussain described as the sounding of bugle for the Lok Sabha polls, a day ahead announcement of the crucial Karnataka Assembly election results. Shah said his party had already belied those who said its massive win in the 2014 poll was a ""fluke"" by winning 11 state Assembly elections and now had over 1,800 MLAs and over 11 crore members. He also expressed confidence that the BJP will wrest Karnataka from the Congress. Amid claims by Opposition parties that the BJP may find the going tough in 2019 if they unite, he said an atmosphere is created before every poll to downplay his party's chances and some people then look for all kinds of reasons to belittle its victory. Besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and organisational strength of the BJP had also played a key role in its successes, he said, adding that the Congress' fall was a result of its arrogance of power and neglect of its organisation, which was destroyed over the years. With the Modi government set to complete its fourth year this month, Shah said it had served the poor, and party workers can take pride in its performance as they strive to retain power in 2019. Claiming that the BJP has not formed government merely to be in power but to change the country, he said it will build an India so strong that the rest of the world will look at it in a manner it beholds the United States, according to Hussain. ""It was said about the BJP that it may form a government once but does not return to power. We have to break this myth. When we will win the election in 2019, then we will prove that we know how to form, run and return to government,"" he said. Shah might have on his mind the fate of the first BJP-led NDA government which had lost in the 2004 Lok Sabha poll despite being seen as favourites to return to power before the election. Political pundits have been watching his party's rise with curiosity, the elite section of society with surprise while its rivals are intrigued, he said, adding that BJP workers are full of self-pride but their satisfaction should not give way to complacency. ""The BJP president has in a way sounded the bugle for the 2019 election. We will win the Karnataka polls tomorrow and have to prepare from today for the 2019 poll,"" Hussain said. The party would not be satisfied till it forms governments in states like Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, he said. In the meeting, Shah also took stock of the organisational work and various targets the party had set for its state units and MPs and MLAs. He also voiced his anguish at the loss of lives due to adverse weather in different parts of the country and asked the party's local units to assist the people in need. Trivedi said Shah also took feedback from leaders about various programmes the party had organised during its recent 'gram swaraj' campaign and also sought suggestions from them on celebrating the fourth anniversary of the Modi government. The party also condemned the violence during panchayat polls in West Bengal and hit out at the Trinamool Congress government.",PTI,FP Staff

": Karnataka deputy chief minister G Parameshwara said on Saturday that no talks have been held so far between his party and Janata Dal (Secular) over seat-sharing for the general elections, which both the parties have decided to contest as a pre-poll alliance. Speaking to reporters here prior to a meeting with the party workers to introspect the party's performance in the recent state Assembly elections, the senior Congress leader said the alliance with JDS is aimed at keeping the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power in 2019. ""We have forged an alliance (with JDS) for the Lok Sabha elections too, to keep BJP away from power. We have not discussed seat sharing (so far). Both parties will sit across the table to decide on the seats. ""Myself and chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will sit together and decide the candidates, based on their strengths without leaving room for any confusion,"" Parameshwara, who is also the state Congress president, said. On the reported rift over the allocation of portfolios, he said the Congress got 22 portfolios, which it would distribute without any hassle. It was binding on both parties to stick to the decision taken in the coalition government, he added. Asked about the issue of Congress MLAs demanding a ministerial post, Parameshwara said there were suggestions that a person who had held the minister's post more than two times should not be given any portfolio. ""I have forwarded their suggestions to the party high command to take a call on that,"" the deputy chief minister said. To a query on raids carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on those linked to Congress leader D K Shivakumar and his MP brother, D K Suresh, he said he was not aware of the agency pressurising those it questioned to name Suresh in connection with an alleged illegal conversion of demonetised currency. He, however, denounced the attempt to frame a person in the name of investigation and interrogation. ""It is a fact that the Centre is misusing the CBI,"" Parameshwara alleged. On the appointment of new party president of the state, Parameshwara said there are many aspirants for the post and many of them are more capable than him. Backing Kumaraswamy's decision to ban mobile phones during meetings chaired by him, Parameshwara said it would help carry out work without causing any embarrassment.

"Soon after Rahul Gandhi demanded an investigation against Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding his role in the Rafale deal and called him a ""corrupt man"", the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the Congress president of ""lying"" and said that the entire   is ""corrupt."" Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra asked Rahul the reason for not approaching the Supreme Court if he claims to have all documents to prove corruption. Referring to Rahul's statement that even former French president has said that the Prime Minister of India is corrupt, Patra challenged the Congress chief to produce a statement where Francois Hollande has claimed thus. Patra accused the Congress leader of ""lying through his teeth shamelessly"" in wrongly quoting the former French president. Quoting Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa as saying that the Rafale deal would be a ""game-changer"", Patra said that Rahul is saying the exact opposite. He asked to country to decide if they want to believe in Rahul or Dhanoa, while accusing the Congress chief of playing with national security.  He further said that Rahul stated in the Parliament that there is no secrecy clause between the countries however, the French government issued a statement moments later refuting his claims. During the debate on the no-confidence motion, Rahul had said that French president Emmanuel Macron had clearly conveyed to him that there was no problem in sharing details relating to the Rafale deal. However,  , France said, ""France and India concluded in 2008 a security agreement, which legally binds the two States to protect the classified information provided by the partner, that could impact security and operational capabilities of the defence equipment of India or France."" The BJP leader further said the Supreme Court has also dismissed a PIL (public interest litigation) that had questioned the aircraft's price and sought the deal cancelled. The Congress-led UPA government had jeopardised the country's defence as the squadron strength of the Air Force fell to 31 from 44, he alleged. Rahul Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert Vadra did not get his share in the Rafale deal and therefore the UPA government cancelled it, he claimed.  Rafale deal is 'clear-cut' case of corruption while reiterating his earlier statement about Reliance Defence being deliberately chosen by the government as the Offset partner for the deal. Dassault Aviation, the company manufacturing the aircraft had issued a statement clarifying on the pact with the Indian government, reiterating that it ""freely chose to partner with Reliance Group"".

" The Congress on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of ""compromising"" on national security and causing a loss of Rs 12,632 crore to the state exchequer on account of purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets. Quoting from the annual report of Dassault Aviation, makers of the fighter aircraft, the party alleged that the company sold each jet to India at Rs 351 crore higher than those sold to Qatar and Egypt 11 months ago. Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Randeep Surjewala said while 36 Rafale jets were sold to India at  7.5 billion in 2016, 48 jets were sold to Qatar and Egypt at € 7.9 billion in 2015. This amounted to Rs 1,670.70 crore per aircraft for India and Rs 1,319.80 crore to Egypt/Qatar. There was a difference of Rs 351 crore for each aircraft, the party claimed. Addressing a joint press conference, Azad, Surjewala and former minister of state for Defence Jitendra Singh asserted that the government had adopted complete opaqueness in the purchase of the Rafale fighter aircraft. Azad asserted that had the Modi government not cancelled the deal struck by the UPA dispensation for 126 Rafale jets, it could have saved Rs 41,212 crore. ""The Modi government's 'diversionary tactics' on Rafale deal has left more questions than answers,"" they said in a statement. Accusing the prime minister of compromising on national security and interests, Azad asked why were only 36 fighter jets purchased instead of 126 jets for which international bids were called for. ""Is this not compromising with national security? Why are prime minister and defence minister hiding the purchase price (of the jets)? Is it correct that per aircraft pricing of Rafale as per bid dated 12 December, 2012 (during the UPA-Congress government) was Rs 526.1 crore as against the Modi government's per aircraft purchase price of Rs 1,670.70 crore?"" he asked. Surjewala said the deal was also made in absence of prior clearance from Cabinet Committee on Security, thus sacrificing the national interest and bypassing Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on the Rs 36,000 crore 'offset contract' in favour of a private entity with no defence manufacturing experience. ""Grave apprehensions and claims of insurmountable loss being caused to public exchequer stand exposed as the government refuses to state the truth.

" The Election Commission's recommendation to disqualify 20 AAP MLAs gave a ray of hope to the beleaguered Congress and BJP in Delhi as they were quick to demand the resignation of Arvind Kejriwal as chief minister. The poll panel's recommendation to the president gave fresh ammunition to the two opposition parties to target Arvind Kejriwal's AAP which emerged as a big political force seeking to fight corruption and bring probity in politics. Both the Congress and the BJP, which suffered badly in the AAP surge that almost wiped them out in the last assembly polls, said they were ready for elections. The Congress was routed with none of its candidates being elected while the BJP managed to win only three seats. The BJP won another seat in the bypolls later. The disqualification of 20 MLAs will not threaten the AAP government as it has 66 MLAs in the 70-member Assembly and would continue to be in majority even if these lawmakers are disqualified. Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken said Kejriwal has no ""moral right"" to continue in power and should resign. He also said the Delhi Congress will launch a 'Jan Andolan' from 22 January demanding the Kejriwal government's removal and expose him on the issue of corruption, on which he contested and won elections. ""Arvind Kejriwal has no moral right to be in power and he should resign. Half of his cabinet ministers have been removed on corruption charges and the remaining half are embroiled in corruption too. Twenty of his MLAs, who enjoyed ministerial perks, would be disqualified now,"" Maken told reporters. On the other hand, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari lauded the EC's recommendation to the president, saying it is a ""moral defeat"" for  Kejriwal and that he should resign. He said the BJP stands prepared for elections any moment. ""We welcome the EC decision disqualifying 20 AAP MLAs. Arvind Kejriwal should take responsibility for moral defeat and resign,"" he said. Maken said the Delhi Congress was ready for polls and held a meeting with its former MLAs representing these seats to gear up for fresh elections. He said Congress leaders have represented some of these seats 4-5 times and the party is prepared for elections. He said the Congress will launch a protest from 22 January by holding ' ' in each of these 20 constituencies to ""expose the double standards"" of the Kejriwal government. ""We are happy the Election Commission has taken this decision,"" Maken said, recalling how in June 2016 the Congress has petitioned against 21 AAP MLAs for holding offices of profit. ""Where is Lokpal? The MLAs and ministers enjoying perks of power and foreign travel — Where is political probity?,"" he tweeted. He said the entire exercise conducted by the EC on the issue would have gone waste had Chief Election Commissioner AK Joti not given the verdict now as he would have retired as has former CEC Nasim Zaidi. Election Commissioner OP Rawat has already recused himself from the issue. The EC on Friday recommended to the president the disqualification of 20 of AAP MLAs for holding office of profit.

"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau landed in India with family on 17 February to begin his week-long visit aimed at strengthening ties between the two countries. Trudeau, on his first state visit to the country after assuming power in 2015, was received not by the Prime Minister, but by a junior minister, the Minister of State for Agriculture, Rajendra Singh Shekhawat. Political observers across the globe were quick to point out this move on part of the Modi government, especially at a time when the Prime Minister has been seen breaking protocol to receive his guests personally – most recently for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – constituted a deliberate snub after the lingering Khalistan issue. Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh has accused several members of the Trudeau cabinet of being Khalistan sympathisers and having links to Sikh separatists, in a very public diplomatic spat. A number of those ministers are part of Trudeau’s contingent to India. Candice Malcolm, a columnist for Canadian daily  , noted Modi’s absence as Trudeau landed: But it is also being argued that Modi not receiving Trudeau personally is simply down to the fact that Canada does not carry the political, strategic or economic heft that the US, Israel, or the UAE does. As Vice India’s news editor tweeted: Observers are perceiving this ‘ ’ as a response to Trudeau’s nonchalant stance on Sikh separatism in Canada. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath too chose not to receive Trudeau and his family in Agra, leaving the organising and meeting to his district magistrate instead. Trudeau and his family were in the city to visit the iconic Taj Mahal. Yogi had earlier received Israeli PM Netanyahu on the latter’s visit in January. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

"A professor at Mahatma Gandhi Central University in Motihari in Bihar’s East Champaran district was   by suspected Hindutva activists on Friday after he posted a comment on Facebook criticising former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Vajpayee died on Thursday and was cremated on Friday. Sanjay Kumar, who teaches in the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology, had commented on a friend’s post that claimed Vajpayee was not a Nehruvian socialist but a staunch loyalist of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh who always pushed the right-wing organisation’s agenda. “ .   [The end of a fascist era, Atal ji begins an unending journey],” Kumar commented on his friend’s post, which had said, “Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a Sanghi and not a Nehruvian. His oratory skills made Hindutva politics a ‘sexy’ thing for Indian middle class. Calling him Nehruvian is a misreading of history.” Following this, he was abused online by suspected members of the RSS and the Bajrang Dal. He started receiving threat calls and messages on WhatsApp on Friday morning.  “He got a call at around 10.30 am and the caller said he would be killed,” Pramod Meena, who heads the university staff association, told  . “At about 1 pm, 10 to 12 goons came to his home and beat him with shoes and steel rods, dragged him down the stairs and to the road. They even poured petrol over him.” But a few students and friends of the professor, who had gathered at his home near the university campus in his support, “managed to stop them and save him”, Meena added. Amid the chaos, a third-year sociology student named Amit Vikram allegedly went missing. The professor’s friends and students alleged that Vikram has been kidnapped. Kumar has been a vocal critic of the university’s vice chancellor and had been participating in a teachers’ protest against the vice chancellor for the past 70 days. In his complaint, he alleged that the attackers had asked him why he had been speaking up against the vice chancellor and a few others. A purported video of the assault shows a person asking Kumar if he wants to “become Kanhaiya Kumar”.  The police initially refused to register a complaint, the professor’s supporters claimed. But   reported that 12 people have been booked, including Sanjay Kumar Singh, who is the local bureau chief of Hindi daily  .  Kumar has been taken to Patna for medical treatment.

"The Congress on Tuesday questioned the setting up of a five-judge bench to hear a petition challenging rejection of the impeachment notice against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra and dismissed allegations that the plea, filed by two party MPs, was ""political"". The party was for protecting ""dignity and independence"" of the courts, senior Congress leader and advocate Kapil Sibal said while pitching for transparency in the judicial process. The Congress MPs, for whom Sibal appeared before the Supreme Court, earlier in the day withdrew their plea in the apex court challenging rejection of the impeachment notice against Misra by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu. During the hearing, Sibal raised questions on the setting up of the constitution bench, including who passed the order for setting up the five-judge bench to hear the matter. Sibal had also sought of a copy of the order on setting up of the bench. “It was not a judicial order, but an administrative one…the petitioners have the right to know who passed the order…we wanted a copy of the order…they (the SC) did not pass any order saying that they will give us the copy of the order or not,” Sibal told reporters at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi. He added that the petitioners intended to challenge the order of setting up of the bench. The former Union minister also said the Congress had no ""personal complaint"" against anyone and dismissed the “government's allegation” that the petition was a “political matter”. “Which order in India cannot be challenged…We just want to say that we want to protect the dignity, independence of courts…transparency in the judicial process…so, the issue we have raised is not political, but one relating to the (developments in) courts,” Sibal said.",PTI,PTI
"The Supreme Court today extended its June 30 deadline for the publication of the final draft of Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) by a month, after the Centre and the state coordinator agreed to publish it within the new time limit. A bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and R.F. Nariman considered the report of state NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela and extended the deadline. Hajela had said last week said it would not be possible to release the final draft of the NRC as scheduled on June 30 due to floods in the state. The NRC is being prepared to identify illegal migrants in Assam. The bench asked the state chief secretary and DGP of Assam to immediately provide adequate security to Hajela and his family members, including his children. It asked them to file a compliance report immediately after taking a decision on the issue. The apex court said it would consider all the interlocutory applications and other related matters on July 31. The first draft NRC for Assam was published at the end of December as per the top court’s direction. The first draft, which is a list of the state’s citizens, was published on the intervening night of December 31 and January 1 where the names of 1.9 crore people out of the 3.29 crore applicants were incorporated.

"The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) began its three-day lecture series at Vigyan Bhavan, in New Delhi on Monday, 17 September where reportedly one of the primary issues to be discussed will be the Ayodhya dispute. Religious leaders from different religions, filmstars, sportspersons, business tycoons, retired judges, former chiefs of the armed forces, ambassadors of over 60 countries, besides the leaders of all the major political parties are expected to attend the event, reported PTI. In his 80-minute long speech, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that the RSS doesn’t seek domination and is indifferent to who comes to power. Bhagwat also asserted that RSS is the “most democratic” and not dictatorial, insisting that it neither imposes its ideology nor remote-controls its various affiliates, apparently rejecting criticism that the BJP is controlled by it. Addressing a gathering of BJP leaders, union ministers, Bollywood actors, artists and academicians, Bhagwat also said India's diversity must be respected, celebrated and it should not be a reason for any discord in society as he extensively talked about evolution of the nearly nine-decade old RSS and its vision for an inclusive India. Bhagwat insisted that ""Hindutva binds us together and our vision of Hindutva is not to oppose or demean anyone"". Bhagwat, who also extensively quoted RSS founder K B Hedgewar in his speech, said the event was being organised so that people could understand the organisation. Woven on the theme, ‘Future of Bharat: An RSS perspective’, the lecture series will be addressed by RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat. An interactive session will also be held on the third day of the event. It will be a first-of-its-kind event to explain the Sangh's perspective on various issues and clear misconceptions about its working and ideology. Therefore, it was felt that people from all walks of life should be invited to it, a Sangh functionary told PTI. The series was announced on 27 August. The same day, RSS functionary Arun Kumar told PTI that people across the country wanted to know and associate with the RSS. Senior functionaries of the RSS said a list of about 500 dignitaries was being prepared for the event. The event, addressed by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, will not see participation from Pakistan as the country has been left out from the list of invitees, given its “strained relations” with India. An RSS functionary told  : However, China will be invited to attend the programme because it has “cultural similarities” with India, the report states. In June this year, Congress veteran and former president Pranab Mukherjee attended an event at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur on the Sangh’s invitation, for which he was criticised by the party leaders.

" A day after the violent ' ' protests, BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday said a ""microscopic minority of dejected and rejected political parties"" made the people suffer and sought their apology to ""Dalit sisters and brothers."" In a series of tweets, Shah reached out to the community, which has been protesting a Supreme Court order on a law on atrocities against it and sought to turn the tables on the Congress by raking up its treatment to Dalit icon Bhimrao Ambedkar. He also blamed ""vested interest groups"" for spreading the panic on the issue of reservation for Dalits, saying it is done before every election and asserted that the government will do everything to protect their rights. Right from the day the apex court gave its judgment on the SC/ST atrocities act, the Central government acted in an ""immediate and informed"" manner and has filed an effective review petition to protect the Dalits' rights, Shah said. He pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met MPs belonging to the Scheduled Castes and had assured them that the government was doing everything to protect the rights and well-being of ""our Dalit sisters and brothers.""  Through the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill, 2015, the NDA government had actually strengthened the provisions of the Act and this was in line with the BJP's commitment to the welfare of the SC & ST communities, he said. ""Due to the politically driven manifestations of a microscopic minority of dejected and rejected political parties, crores of innocent people suffered. These parties owe our Dalit sisters and brothers an apology for their misdeeds,"" he said. Shah, whose party has often accused the opposition of fuelling unfounded campaign against it before elections, said the script had now become old and that vested interest groups started spreading panic about reservations before polls. The BJP is locked in a keen fight with the Congress in the Karnataka assembly elections, scheduled for 12 May. ""The BJP's stand is clear, which I am once again stating — we fully believe in the Constitution given by Babasaheb and the rights it has given to the SC/ST communities. At every juncture and in all possible ways, the BJP stands shoulder to shoulder with the Dalit community,"" he said. The Modi government's commitment to fulfilling Ambedkar's vision was unwavering and all its efforts were aimed at transforming the lives of Dalits, Shah claimed. Attacking the Congress for ""mocking"" Modi's DNA, he said the party had defeated Ambedkar in Lok Sabha polls twice and made ""flimsy excuses"" to ensure his portrait was not placed in Parliament's Central Hall.  It also denied him a Bharat Ratna, he said, claiming that India had seen through its negative politics. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had said in a tweet that the DNA of the BJP and RSS was anti-Dalit.

"Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, and claimed that his government has ignored the interests of farmers but helped a small group of industrialists by waiving loans amounting to nearly Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Addressing party workers belonging to the Other Backward Class (OBC) community during a public meeting at Delhi's Talkatora Stadium, Rahul said people who work hard behind the scenes never benefit in India, since the fruits of their toil are enjoyed by others. ""There will be loan waivers for a handful of people. Even if the farmers cry, their families suffer and commit suicide, there will not be relief given to them. Work is being put in by some people, but some others take home the profits,"" he said. ""People with skills are not rewarded in India... farmers work hard but you don't see them in the offices of Modi  ,"" he said. Rahul claimed that the non-performing assets of banks have gone up to Rs 1,000 crore. ""Rs 2.5 lakh crore were given to 15 industrialists."" He also challenged the stand of the government that India lacks skills, said it was not true and the authorities have failed to recognise that fact. He drew parallels between India and the US, and cited the example of fast food firms such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's. The former, a soft drink behemoth, was started by a man selling   (lemonade) in the US, Rahul said, highlighting the fact that in the West, people are rewarded for putting in industry and honest labour, unlike in India. ""A man who used to sell   by mixing sugar and water was appreciated for his skill and hard work. He made money and used it to start the Coca-Cola company,"" he said. ""A man running a   (roadside eatery) founded the McDonald's chain. Show me one   owner in India who can do this,"" he said. ""Is it because the   owners don't have the necessary skills? No, it's because the doors of our banks and our politicians are shut as far as they are concerned. They don't get any support from the officials."" He also hit out at Modi for claiming that there is a shortage of skills in India. ""Modi says Indians lack skills, which is a lie. There is no shortage of skilled people, especially among OBCs. There are skilled people anywhere you look. The fact remains that there is no acknowledgement of the skills present,"" he added.",FP Staff,Press Trust of India

Almost everybody on the Opposition, and also some members of the BJP alliance, feel that there is an encroachment taking place on Indian institutions. You saw four Supreme Court judges come out and say that they were not allowed to do their work,"" said Gandhi. ""There is a feeling in the Opposition that for the first time, an organisation is challenging the very idea of India. We need to defend the inclusive idea of India,"" he said. ""You can look at the UP and Bihar alliances as the central areas (for a  ),"" he added. ""What we are defending is the onslaught on the Indian Constitution. And the entire Opposition sees it as defending the nature of the Indian state,"" Gandhi said. ""Our first priority is to defeat the BJP and stop the poison from being spread."" ""We are actually constructing a manifesto for the Congress at the state and national level. We are also talking to allies on what a (united) framework would look like. There are also some parties that are not now aligned with the BJP,"" Gandhi said. ""I see this as an ideological battle. We are not going to make alliances with anybody who is not on our ideological platform,"" he added. On the issue of minority rights, Gandhi said that since everyone in India contributes to its development, everyone needs to benefit. ""There are two big transitions taking place on this planet on a massive scale. There is the movement of Chinese people from their villages into their urban areas. The Chinese have organised it. We have a less organised, more chaotic and more organic structure,"" he said. ""Whatever we have achieved so far has been achieved on the back of all Indian people. If the whole of India has sacrificed to get us where we are, the whole of India has to benefit,"" he added. ""You cannot say: We are going to exclude tribals, Dalits, farmers, women. There shouldn't be a single Indian person who should feel that his or her voice is not heard,"" said the Congress president. When asked about the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the Congress, Gandhi said, ""Congress is an idea that is very old. It is not a new idea, similar to the RSS, which is also an old idea. If you read our history, these ideas have been in combat for thousands of years."" ""The RSS vision is a top-to-bottom hierarchy where knowledge is centralised. Congress vision is a decentralised structure,"" he said. ""The Congress has this idea embedded deep inside it. You find non-violence in them (Congress leaders),"" he added. ""Our weakness is that the Congress is not able to express that idea to people. People struggle to see that idea clearly,"" Gandhi said. ""It's very clear what the BJP, RSS are saying. The RSS has spent a certain amount of time working on that idea. Gandhiji used to do that for us. That's where Congress has not kept pace. But the good news is that the idea is there in Congress."" ""Congress has over time closed itself. The Congress needs to open itself. Congress needs to be precise about what it stands for,"" he added. ""The opportunity for the Congress for me is bringing in millions of Indians youngsters and delivering to them an organisation which empowers them to transform India,"" Gandhi said. ""Threat in the Congress: arrogance,"" he said. ""The reason Congress ran intro trouble in 2014 was because we found that there was an internal fight taking place between the old and younger generation. We have worked on that,"" Gandhi said. When asked about his views on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Gandhi vaguely said that he was strictly against any form of violence. ""I think when Manmohan Singh spoke, he spoke for all of us. As I said earlier, I am a victim of violence. I know what it feels like. I am against any sort of violence,"" he said. ""I condemn that 100 percent. I am 100 percent for punishment for people involved in any sort of violence,"" he added, after which the crowd broke into applause. ""People who haven't faced violence think that violence is something you see in movies. I have seen people whom I loved very much being killed. I have also seen the person who killed my father being killed and I can say that when I saw Mr Prabhakaran lying on the beaches in Jaffna, when I saw him being humiliated, I felt sorry for him because I saw my father in his place. And I saw his children in my place,"" said the Congress president. When asked about dynastic politics, Gandhi said that even though him being part of a political family had helped him enter politics, he still had to struggle and fight elections like any other politician. ""I have fought three elections. So, the term 'dynasty' is not precise because I am actually elected. The important thing is that I operate in a democracy and I work with people.

"The Jammu & Kashmir government on Monday sacked state finance minister Haseeb Drabu for his controversial comment ""Kashmir is not a political issue"" and the province is not a ""conflict state"".  Drabu who is an economist and has vast experience in financial domain had taken charge as the state finance minister on 4 March 2015. 
 The state government led by chief minister Mehbooba Mufti's Peoples Democratic Party has sent Drabu's sacking letter to governor Narinder Nath Vohra for a final decision. Two days ago on 10 March, Drabu had said Jammu and Kashmir should not be seen as a conflict state or a political problem, but as a society with social issues.  Speaking at an event themed ‘Kashmir: the way forward' here last night, Drabu asked the people to “introspect” over the nature and origins of the situation in the state and how it can be resolved,   had reported on Saturday.

" The release of a purported video clip of the army's 2016 surgical strikes created a political furore on Thursday with the Congress accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP of politicising sacrifices of soldiers to garner votes, evoking a sharp reaction from the ruling party. The BJP said that the Congress was behaving more like a fringe player than a mainstream party by ""questioning"" the armed forces and such statements by it will only make terrorists happy in Pakistan. Several TV channels on Wednesday showed video clips reportedly of the surgical strikes which were carried out on terror launch pads across the border in September 2016. The defence ministry or the army has not offered any comment on the footage. Addressing a press conference, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said while on the one hand, the Modi government is seeking credit for the sacrifice and valour of the armed forces, on the other, it has failed to provide a direction and vision to deal with Pakistan. The blood and sacrifice of the country's brave soldiers cannot be a political vote-garnering tool, he said, accusing the government of giving a ""step-motherly treatment"" to the armed forces by not providing them with state-of-the-art equipment and slashing their budgetary allocation. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, fielded by the BJP to counter the Opposition charge, accused the Congress of repeatedly making statements that questioned the commitment and bravery of the armed forces, and lowering their morale. Such comments make it clear that the Congress is no longer a mainstream party but a fringe player in the national politics, he said, adding it does not look like the same party which ruled the country for over 60 years. Terrorists and their patrons in Pakistan would be the happiest with the Congress' stand, which has given them a ""campaign handle"" against India, Prasad said. The Congress' only aim seems to be directed at breaking the morale of the armed forces, he said and asked it to answer if it considers the video real or not and approves of the surgical strikes or not. Prasad said that the opposition party has become so desperate with its repeated losses in elections that it has been repeatedly questioning the commitment and courage of the armed forces. 
If the BJP wanted to draw political mileage, then a video purportedly showing the army's operation in PoK would have been released during polls in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat or Karnataka, he said. Earlier, Surjewala said the September 2016 surgical strikes were “shamelessly politicised” by the BJP for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in March last year. ""Let the ruling dispensation remember that the blood and sacrifice of our brave soldiers cannot become a political vote-garnering tool for the Modi government and the BJP,"" he told reporters. By making public the videos of the strikes, has the government not somehow endangered lives of armed forces personnel who participated in the action as also civilians living along the Line of Control, he asked. ""The government has utterly failed to provide a direction, vision and policy for dealing with Pakistan and checkmate Pak-sponsored terrorism,” he said. Surjewala said the ""apathy"" and ""incapacity"" of the Modi government has resulted in the sacrifice of 146 soldiers, more than 1,600 ceasefire violations by Pakistan and 79 terrorist attacks post-September 2016. ""The doublespeak of the Modi government and the BJP stands reflected in the step-motherly treatment of our armed forces, both in terms of providing for security apparatus as also in slashing the budgetary allocation. ""Vice-chief of army staff Lieutenant General Sarath Chand was forced to publicly state that 68 percent of all equipment is vintage,"" he said. Rebutting the charge, Prasad said the budgetary allocation for the defence sector at Rs 2.95 lakh crore this year was the highest and cited several measures, including implementation of the one rank one pension scheme, besides casualty welfare funds and the decision to set up a national war museum, to underscore the government's commitment to the armed forces. The Congress' problem is that the Modi government has shut the door on taking of commission in defence deals and it cannot live without this, he claimed. The law minister also attacked the Congress for equating Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, calling it shameful and a reflection on the opposition party's ""political decline."" Likening a global leader like Modi to Aurangzeb is a new low, he said. At the Congress press meet, Surjewala asked whether former prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh were wrong when they used surgical strikes for strategic and security purposes without any chest-thumping. Asked about the surfacing of the video, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar did not give a direct reply. ""As far as the video is concerned you have to recall that on 29 September, 2016 from this very place, there was a joint press briefing by MEA and MOD (Ministry of Defence). We had made our position on the surgical strikes very clear during that press conference,"" he said.  On Pakistan sheltering terror groups, he said Islamabad has to take steps to control terrorism which is coming out from its territory. ""It has to rein in the terrorists who are operating freely in the country,"" he said.",Press Trust of India,PTI
"Levelling a string of charges against the Narendra Modi government, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Thursday claimed at a press conference held in New Delhi that the Centre and its agencies had forced AgustaWestland accused Christian Michel to sign a false confession naming Sonia Gandhi in return for complete exoneration. On Wednesday, Michel, a middleman in the VVIP chopper scam, was arrested in Dubai. However, the middleman alleged that the agencies had forced him to reveal connections with the former Congress president. Interestingly, the Opposition party's press conference comes a day before the no-confidence motion debate in Parliament. Beginning with how ""stunning revelations have blown the lid off the concerted conspiracy, blind vendetta and web of lies"" by ""Narendra Modi against the Congress leadership"", Surjewala went onto say that the mudslinging, muckraking and hatchet job enacted by the Modi government and its ‘Dirty Tricks Department’ i.e CBI/ED, to smear the Opposition leaders is out in the open for the nation to see and adjudge. ""Modi government has been the protector and benefactor of a company like AgustaWestland,"" claimed Surjewala. The Congress spokesperson further said that Indian agencies are merely involved in hatching a conspiracy against the leaders of the Opposition and using Michel as a tool for the purpose. On Tuesday, the Indian government was supposed to produce evidence in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) court against Michel. ""But the government did not present any evidence,"" Michel's lawyer, Rosemary Patrizi Dos Anjos, told   over the phone from Milan in Italy. ""Never before in the history of India has a prime minister been found complicit in gaining false evidence against Opposition leaders to seek revenge,"" Surjewala said. The Congress spokesperson also said the shocking expose is also a testimony to the disease prevailing in CBI or ED which prostrates before the prime minister to collect false evidence with a single-handed aim of tarnishing the reputation of Opposition leaders. Surjewala added that to protect the national interest, the former UPA-Congress government had proceeded to encash the securities/bank guarantees (both in India and abroad) and recovered an amount of Rs 2,068 crore against the original payment of Rs 1,620 crore. The UPA government had also confiscated three AgustaWestland helicopters worth Rs 886.50 crore as per the contract value. Thus, the UPA-Congress government had effectively recovered nearly Rs 3,000 crore. Surjewala also brought up how on 26 August, 2014, the Modi government ""undid the order of blacklisting of Finmeccanica and Agusta Westland"" and asked AgustaWestland to be part of Make in India programme and participate in Aero India Exhibition. In April 2015, the government had permitted AgustaWestland to bid for 100 Navy Utility Helicopters.

""The Karnataka governor's hasty invitation to the BJP to form a government despite the majority of MLAs forming a post-poll alliance of INC-JD(S)-BSP is arbitrary and unconstitutional.

"Setting the tone for the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, 9 September he sees ""no challenge"" to the BJP and described unity efforts among Opposition parties ""unable to stand each other"" as a proof of his government's popularity and his party's big success. Giving the slogan of 'Ajeya Bharat, Atal Bhajapa' (Invincible India, firm BJP), he exuded confidence that his party will win in 2019. ""We have started our journey with confidence of victory. We enjoy the confidence of 125 crore people of India."" In his concluding address at the party's two-day national executive meeting, Modi also heaped scorn on Congress president Rahul Gandhi, saying his party's leadership is not acceptable to any ally, is seen as a burden by some others and is not acceptable to a few within his own party. ""We do not see any challenge,"" he said, lashing out at the Opposition over its allegations based on ""falsehoods and lies"" against his government. When they were in power they were a failure, and they are a failure even in Opposition, he said. Slamming rival parties, he said they cannot see eye to eye and never stand by each other but have been forced to embrace one another to challenge the BJP. It shows the government's popularity and acceptance of its programmes and leadership by the people, he said. He said his government has lived up to the slogan of ' ' by bringing development to all without any consideration of caste, religion or region. The Opposition has not challenged the government on issues or its policies and ideology, but manufacture lies everyday and keeps repeating it, he said, apparently in reference to its attack on him over issues of corruption in the Rafale deal and demonetisation among others. He asked the BJP workers to ""unmask"" the Congress with facts and logic. On a day BJP president Amit Shah claimed that his party would rule for 50 years on the basis of its performance once it comes to power in 2019, Modi like Shah also cited the example of Gujarat where it has had an almost uninterrupted reign for 31 years. Modi said unlike other parties, the BJP has neither arrogance of power nor does it see government as a chair to grab by all means but uses it as an instrument to empower people. ""We work to fulfil our principles to which we remain firm. Our strategy may change from time to time,"" he said. It is important to ask what benefits the poor got during the period, he said. The world, Modi said, is discussing policies of his government based on "" "" (With everyone by our side, everyone’s development will be ensured). He spoke of the intensive drive to cover the poor households, especially in villages with high concentration of scheduled castes and tribes, with LPG connections, electricity and insurance cover among other welfare measures. Modi also mentioned the newly-launched health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat, that seek to cover over 10 crore poor families. On simultaneous polls, he said his government has already done ""one nation, one tax"", a reference to the Goods and Services Tax, and ""one nation, one power grid"", but is not for creating pressure on this issue. He wanted a debate in all sections of society on the issue of simultaneous polls, he said. Asked if issues such as the Opposition's allegation on the Rafale deal or the raging issue of rise in oil prices came up for discussion, Prasad answered in the negative. Different government functionaries have been speaking on this matter. Asked about the Ram temple issue, he said the matter is currently being heard in the Supreme Court.

The repatriation process is scheduled to be completed by September 25. At a meeting held earlier this month, Ministry of Home Affairs’ Joint Secretary (North East) Satyendra Garg appealed to the Bru refugees housed in relief camps in Tripura to return to Mizoram as assistances doled out to them would be withdrawn from October 1. Thousands of Brus had been lodged in the Tripura relief camps since late 1997 in the wake of a communal tension triggered by the brutal killing of Lalzawmliana, a forest guard, inside the Dampa Tiger Reserve on October 21, 1997 by Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) militants. The first attempt to repatriate them from November 16, 2009 not only failed but triggered another wave of exodus after Bru militants gunned down a youth at Bungthuam village, three days before the commencement of the repatriation process.

"Three days after nine children were mowed down by an SUV in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district on Saturday, the Bhartiya Janta Party on 26 February suspended its worker Manoj Baitha, an accused in the hit-and-run case. At least nine children were killed and about 20 injured when the speeding vehicle lost control outside a government school building on the outskirts of Muzaffarpur on Saturday. Muzaffarpur district president Subodh Singh has sent a communication to this effect to the party's state headquarters, Kumar told PTI. Meanwhile, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has announced that he will not celebrate Holi this year, following the school children’s death and the death of RJD leader Manibhushan Nishad, ANI reported on 27 February. An SIT led by city SP Upendra Nath Verma has been formed to arrest Baitha, the report added. Baitha is a BJP worker but does not hold any position in the party at the district or state level, said Bihar BJP chief and Ujiyarpur MP Nityanand Rai. The owner of the vehicle has been identified by the district transport office, said Muzaffarpur SSP Vivek Kumar, according to  . Residents in nearby areas told police that three people absconded the spot, leaving the SUV behind. However, Narayan Baitha, father of the accused, told ANI that he is unaware of the car’s whereabouts after the driver took the car from the spot. Earlier on Monday, an FIR was lodged against Baitha over the children's death. The parents of the children have demanded his arrest,   reported. Singh said that raids were conducted to arrest the worker who hails from Sitamarhi district but he is absconding, IANS report added. Opposition parties in Bihar on Monday questioned the delay in the arrest of the accused BJP worker, IANS reported. Additionally, closed circuit television (CCTV) camera footage obtained from a toll plaza also showed the Bolero sporting a BJP flag. ""The vehicle had a BJP board attached to it and the driver was drunk at the time of incident. BJP leaders are totally drunk in power,"" Tejashwi Yadav had said on Saturday. He demanded that a probe be conducted to establish whether Baitha, ""who was driving the vehicle at the time of incident"", was drunk or not in the ""dry state of Bihar"". Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted on the matter, asking Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to come clean about the incident. RJD MLA from Minapur, Munna Yadav, who rushed to the spot after the mishap, alleged that the driver of the vehicle was ""definitely inebriated.” While the RJD accused the BJP of protecting its worker, BJP leaders, including Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, have denied any association with Baitha. Both the CM and deputy CM condoled the tragic incident and ordered a ""speedy probe and tough action against the guilty driver.” On 25 February, a day after the tragic accident, Kumar also chaired a meeting over road safety.

" Asserting that electronic voting machines (EVMs) are ""absolutely credible"", former Chief Election Commissioner T S Krishnamurthy on Monday said any move to revert to the old practice of paper ballots is a ""retrograde"" step. The paper ballot system is susceptible to manipulation, leads to wastage of paper and takes longer to announce poll results, among other disadvantages, he told  . Describing EVMs as the ""nation's pride"" and ""absolutely credible"", Krishnamurthy said it's unfortunate that some political parties are calling for the reintroduction of paper ballots. ""Just because some parties didn't do well in the elections, it does not mean the machine is bad. So, in my opinion, it will be a retrograde step if the machines are withdrawn. In my opinion, EVMs are absolutely credible"", he said. Krishnamurthy said the paper ballot system would probably take one week for election results to be announced. ""So much of paper wastage will be there. Under the ballot box itself, so much of manipulation will be there. We know, in some of the elections, bogus ballot paper is used to cast (votes). Checks and balances in the EVMs are not available in the conventional ballot box system,"" he said. ""Once you have ballot papers, there can be invalid votes,"" he said. ""Some of the countries have admired our system and suddenly to withdraw it is a retrograde step,"" he added. The Congress last week urged that the Election Commission revert to the old practice of paper ballots in future elections instead of EVMs. This is necessary as there are misgivings on ""misuse"" of EVMs to ""manipulate the outcome contrary to popular verdict"", the party said during its 84th plenary session. Some other political parties have been alleging that EVMs were tampered with during polls and demanding reintroduction of the ballot paper system of voting.

"With less than a week to go for the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha elections, political heavyweights have reached the state to address election rallies in strategic Assembly constituencies. Prime Minister   will address a rally in Mandsaur, BJP president Amit Shah will address a gathering in Chhindwara, while Congress president   will hold three back-to-back rallies in Vidisha and Sehore, considered as the home turf of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Mandsaur had been the epicentre of the   and mob violence in June 2017, that led to the death of six farmers in police firing. The protest by farmers has come as a challenge for Chouhan, who calls himself a "" "" (poor farmer’s son). While the state BJP hopes that Modi's visit will boost its chances, the state Congress has questioned the prime minister's visit by asking, “Where was Modi when Mandsaur was on fire and six farmers were killed? Does he have the right to ask for votes from the people of Mandsaur?” On the other hand, Amit Shah will hold a rally in Chhindwara – the parliamentary constituency and pocket borough of MPCC president Kamal Nath, from where he has been elected to the Lok Sabha ten times. A Congress stronghold, Chhindwara has seven Assembly seats. According to political analysts, while this election would   for the ruling BJP in the last 15 years, it will be equally crucial for the Congress, which has been out of power since 2003. On Friday, Rahul will hold three back-to-back public meetings at Basoda in Vidisha district, at industrial town Mandideep in Raisen, and Nasrullaganj in Sehore. The Vidisha Lok Sabha constituency has eight Assembly segments — Budhni, Vidisha, Ichhawar, Silwani, Basoda, Khategaon, Bhojpur and Sanchi. During the last election, Chouhan won both from Vidisha and Budhni (Sehore district), and retained the latter. However, of late, the chief minister has been facing the heat from the voters of Budhni. Recently, when Chouhan’s wife Sadhna Singh visited Budhni, she had to face the ire of the locals, who complained to her about the lack of basic amenities like drinking water, etc in the area. The state unit of the Congress is expecting that Rahul’s visit to Basoda in Vidisha and Nasrullaganj, which is in Budhni (Sehore) will turn the tables in favour of the party. The importance of Budhni cannot be underestimated as Arun Yadav, former MPCC president and Union minister of state during the UPA-I regime, has been pitted against Chouhan. Besides Madhya Pradesh, Rahul will also address a public meeting at Medchal in Telangana. However, for the Congress in Telangana, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi's rally on Friday at the same place will be the most important one. Her visit will be the first since the state was formed in June 2014. Telangana is important for the Congress, as it was the UPA which had approved the bifurcation of the state of Andhra Pradesh, when Sonia was the Congress president. She had played a vital role in the creation of the state. The Telangana Congress will also release its ‘people’s manifesto’ on Friday.

"As the death of tigress Avni in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district last week continues to create a furore, Maharashtra Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has sought to counter the allegations made by Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, who has called the tigress’ death “nothing but a straight case of crime”. In an interview with  , Mungantiwar pointed out that with regard to the incident, all procedures were legally carried out as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NCTA) guidelines. The 'man-eating' tigress, Avni, (officially known as T1), said to be responsible for 14 deaths in Maharashtra's Yavatmal, was shot dead on the night 2 November after a massive operation spanning two months. Following reports of the tigress's death, Maneka Gandhi lashed out at the forest minister, saying that the shooter Asgar Ali “illegally” murdered the tigress. Refuting Gandhi’s claims, Mungantiwar said the shooter Asgar Ali, son of well-known shooter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, was authorised to be on the team carrying out the operation. Mungantiwar said the entire team was present on the night of the incident, indicating that the veterinary doctor was also present. He also added that Gandhi, who criticised his department on social media, did so without having full knowledge of the matter. Meanwhile, the shooter Asgar Ali maintained that he shot the tigress in self-defence and denied the “trigger-happy allegations” levelled against him. He maintained that efforts were made to capture and save the tigress over a period of two years, adding that this time around too, the team tried its best to capture the animal alive. Earlier,   to The News Minute, Asgar Ali had expressed sadness over the killing, saying, “What kind of satisfaction can one get by killing the national animal?” After her her tweets, Maneka Gandhi also asked Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis to “remove” state forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar from his post, calling him a “liability” and accusing him of issuing orders to shoot tigress T1 in Pandharkawada, allegedly without any effort to tranquilise her,  reported on Tuesday. Gandhi also said a petition is being readied to be presented in court against T1’s “murder”. News18 reported that Maneka wrote another letter to Fadnavis, reiterating her demand of removing Mungantiwar. Responding to Gandhi’s reported demand, Mungantiwar told the channel, “I will resign if what I am saying about the SC order is wrong. Else she (Maneka Gandhi) should resign.” Earlier on Monday, when asked about Union Minister Maneka Gandhi's statements on the tigress' killing, Fadnavis said the former had used ""harsh words"". In a series of tweets on Sunday, Gandhi had said, ""It is nothing but a straight case of crime. Despite several requests from many stakeholders, (Sudhir) Mungantiwar, minister for forests, Maharashtra, gave orders for the killing."" Fadnavis had said, ""She (Maneka) has used harsh words. But her sentiments should be understood. All animal lovers' sentiments are harsh regarding this incident. It was a difficult decision. Whether the procedure was correct or not will be checked."" Devendra Fadnavis had also said on Monday that the killing of Avni was a sad incident and any procedural lapse in it would be probed. Speaking to reporters, he said, “There is no happiness over the killing. The forest department took the decision since she had killed 13 to 14 people. There are some doubts regarding whether the tigress was first shot and then the dart inserted, this aspect will be probed.” ""We speak of increasing tiger population and conserving wildlife, and then unfortunately such a decision had to be taken. The tiger is a gentleman. He attacks only if his habitat is violated. Preliminary reports with me say the tigress attacked the forest department team and she was shot in self-defence,"" the Maharashtra CM said. ""Hunter Asgar Ali was hired by the forest department. The doubts raised regarding the killing will be verified,"" he added. Rahul Gandhi also tweeted against the killing of the tigress, which prompted a strong reaction from Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan.

" Bishop Franco Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested Friday night amid mounting public outrage over allegations of repeatedly raping and sexually assaulting a nun, police said. He was arrested by Kerala police after  . The development came a day after the Vatican relieved him “temporarily” of all pastoral responsibilities as the bishop of the Jalandhar diocese of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation to which the alleged victim also belongs. The nun had accused the 54-year-old clergyman of repeatedly raping and having unnatural sex with her between 2014 and 2016. Inspector General of Police (Kochi Range) Vijay Sakhare told PTI that the arrest was recorded at 8 pm and the bishop would be produced in a magistrate court in Pala in Kottayam district Saturday. Mulakkal, who had been coming for the interrogation in the bishop attire, was taken to Tripunithura government taluk hospital in a civil dress for medical examination and later to Kottayam. People gathered there booed the bishop as he was being escorted out of the hospital. Earlier, Kottayam district police chief Hari Sankar told reporters that the bishop has been slapped with charges, including rape, illegal confinement, unnatural sex and intimidation. There were pieces of evidence to arrive at a reasonable suspicion that the clergyman had committed the crime, he said. During the interrogation, the accused was given reasonable time to narrate his version to the investigating team, he said. The SP said the police will seek a three-day custody of Mulakkal. Potency test of the priest will be done, he added. Members of various Christian reformation organisations as also the nuns of the Missionaries of Jesus, who were staging a protest close to the Kerala high court premises for the last 13 days for the bishop’s arrest, erupted with joy as the news broke. Fr Augustine Vattoli, Convenor of the Save our Sisters (SOS) Action Council, which spearheaded the protest, called off the hunger strike. The five nuns who were taking part in the protest welcomed the arrest of the bishop and said they would end their agitation for the time being. They hastened to add that justice would not be done simply because of the arrest. “Clear legal steps should also be taken to deliver justice. Law should take its correct course”, a fellow nun of the survivor nun said. The nuns said they would continue their struggle till “complete justice” was done in the case. They said in view of the arrest, more nuns were likely to come forward to complain against the bishop. “More evidence is likely to come to the fore as he is arrested now. Our struggle was not only for the victimised nun. It was for seeking justice for all women victims who were crying for justice”, the nun said. In her complaint to Kottayam police in June, the nun had alleged that Bishop Mulakkal raped her at a guest house in Kuravilangad in May 2014 and later sexually exploited her on several occasions. She said she had to approach police as the church authorities did not act on her repeated complaints against the clergyman. Earlier this month, she wrote to the Vatican’s representative in New Delhi, alleging that the bishop was using “political and money power” to “bury” the case and seeking his removal. The sleaze scandal got murkier when the bishop too filed a complaint against the nun, claiming he was being blackmailed by her for not extending her favours. Outrage over the delay in the top clergyman’s arrest, meanwhile, grew. The protests by Christian reformation organisations escalated after some nuns of the religious order came out of the confines of their convent and joined the agitation. As pressure mounted on police for action against Mulakkal, it asked him to present himself before the Special Investigation Team on September 19. A day ahead of his scheduled appearance, Mulakkal filed an anticipatory bail petition in the Kerala high court claiming allegations against him were a “cooked up story to wreak vengeance”. In his petition, Mulakkal said he was “absolutely innocent” and was “falsely implicated” with an “ulterior motive and vexatious intention”. Mulakkal alleged that the nun had an illicit relationship with a relative and a complaint about it was received by her congregation. “This crucial aspect needs to be considered along with the complaint made by her own cousin alleging the de facto complainant of having an illicit relationship with her husband. “This crucial aspect casts serious suspicion on the credibility of the allegations raised by the de facto complainant,” Mulakkal said in his plea before the high court, which was to hear it on September 25. Citing convention, some legal experts had said the bishop was unlikely to be arrested as his pre-arrest bail plea was pending before the high court. However, since there was no legal bar on his arrest during the pendency of the petition, the police went ahead and detained him.",PTI,PTI

" Forced to live under a temporary shelter for months, a father of six children, including a physically-challenged daughter, is frustrated by the apathy of authorities in Jammu and Kashmir and is cursing his stars. Showkat Ali Khan has set up a shelter with a polythene-covered roof in the remote Malsu village under Sarna Panchayat. He and his family virtually live under the open sky since the assistance promised under the centrally-sponsored Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) to build a concrete shelter has not yet come. Expecting the money, Khan had demolished his one-room mud house, which, he said, was a home for his wife and children. Monsoon rains have compounded their trouble. They desperately want to move into the promised new home before the onset of the unforgiving winter season. Khan, 50, is not alone in his desperate pursuit of a home for his family. The government had identified 28 beneficiaries under the Awas Yojana in Bhaderwah block, but 17 of them have not even received the first installment of the promised monetary assistance to rebuild their homes. Nima Devi, a widow from Kharothi village, said that she has paid several visits to the rural development department office but the “indifference” of the officials there has frustrated her. These homeless people are angry and annoyed that the promises made to them by the authorities have not been kept. Bhaderwah block development officer (BDO) Mohammad Ashraf admitted that there has been a delay in transferring the money to some of the beneficiaries, including Khan. Ashraf said that the delay was due to issues related to bank accounts of the beneficiaries, but he gave the assurance that they would receive the money soon. “We have taken a serious note of the complaint and holding an inquiry, and if anybody is found guilty, appropriate action will be taken against that person,” stressed the BDO. Khan, however, said that his refusal to bribe officials was the main obstacle stopping the transfer of assistance. “We dismantled our mud-room structure on the advice of rural department officials after being informed that Rs 1.30 lakh stands sanctioned under PMAY in my favour in April. I borrowed money and completed the first phase (plinth work) on May 9, hoping to get the first installment of Rs 50,000 transferred to my account,” Khan told PTI. He said that the decision to dismantle the mud structure has left his family homeless and under the open sky. He added that they now share the polythene-roof temporary shelter with the cattle. Under these trying circumstances, Khan said that he was still quite content with his life. However, he added that the money he has borrowed sometimes gives him sleepless nights. “I owe money to many people for completing the plinth work. I do not have money to feed my family or take them to a concrete accommodation. How can I pay commission to the officials?” said Khan, a labourer by profession. His elder daughter, Aafiya, was more direct in holding the rural department officials responsible for their miseries. “Over the past four months, we have braved rain and threat of wild animals. The village-level worker is seeking Rs 40,000 to clear our case. My father has no money to pay him,” she said. Nima Devi, a 75-year-old widow, also dismantled her temporary shelter to start the construction of a pucca house.

" The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) kept the pot boiling on the Sabarimala issue on Wednesday with Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan lashing out at the Left government, saying its ""master plan"" was to ""harass"" pilgrims, as the Kerala High Court slammed the police for its alleged excesses on devotees. As the stand-off on the entry of women of menstrual age into the shrine continued, A Padmakumar, president of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) that manages the shrine, said their aim was to have a peaceful atmosphere in the temple and the TDB was prepared to hold talks with anyone in the matter. In the midst of the tense situation, there was no rush of devotees and the 18 holy steps, which normally sees a heavy crowd, wore a deserted look. Criticising the Inspector General of Police in-charge of Sabarimala and Superintendent of Police for the alleged action against pilgrims at Sabarimala and Nilackal recently, the court asked whether these officials had any criminal antecedents. The court also observed that experienced officials should be put in charge. A division bench, comprising Justices PR Ramachandra Menon and N Anil Kumar, directed the Pathanamthitta district magistrate to produce all files and records which led to the declaration of Section 144 banning assembly of four or more people in Sabarimala 'Sannidhanam' and surrounding areas. Hitting out at the CPM-led LDF government, Radhakrishnan said its ""master plan"" was to ""harass"" the devotees and not allow them to go to the Ayyappa temple. The union minister, who offered prayers at the hill shrine this evening carrying his   (holy bundle 
with offering to Lord Ayyappa) was displeased with the manner in which Superintendent of Police Yatish Chandra had behaved with him at Nilackal, a base camp. When the minister wanted to know why private vehicles of devotees were not being allowed to Pamba from Nilackal, while Kerala state transport corporation buses were plying, the officer explained that post floods the facilities at Pamba were meagre. The senior police officer explained to the Union minister about the features of Pamba, an environmentally fragile area. He also said if the Union minister gives him in writing to allow private vehicles to Pamba, he was prepared to allow all vehicles. ""He asked me whether I will take responsibility. Can the Superintendent of Police ask the same question to a state minister of Kerala? Will they allow him to ask this query?"" Radhakrishnan asked reporters after offering prayers. The minister declined to answer a question on the 28 September Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all ages to offer worship at the shrine, saying ""I do not want to go into that...my concern is with devotees. Do not harass the devotees."" State BJP general secretary, AN Radhakrishnan, who was accompanying the minister, alleged that the IPS officer spoke ""arrogantly"" and ""misbehaved"" with the Union minister. He said that the matter would be brought to the Centre's notice. The Indian Police Service Association, Kerala chapter, on Wednesday night, had condemned the ""continued personal attacks and threats"" made against the IPS officers on duty at Sabarimala by certain individuals and organisations. ""We strongly denounce the attack on officers on religious and personal lines,"" it said, adding that the association was exploring possibilities of moving the Supreme Court in this regard. It also sought the intervention of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the matter. In a statement issued in Thiruvananthapuram, the association said comments purportedly made by the judiciary, as seen from media reports, personally on the officers' background, has also been highly demoralising for these officers who have been engaged following orders of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a court in Pathanamthitta district on Wednesday granted conditional bail to 72 people, including Kerala BJP general secretary K Surendran, who were arrested in connection with the Sabarimala temple row. Surendran along with two others had been arrested on 18 November from Nilackal as he tried to proceed to the Ayyappa Temple despite being advised by police personnel against visiting the shrine due to law and order issues. The 69 others were arrested after they held a   (chanting Lord Ayyappa mantras) inside the shrine complex late on Sunday, defying prohibitory orders. Though it is 55 days since the Supreme Court delivered its verdict, no women in the traditionally barred age group of 10-50 years have made it to the temple. Some devotees on Wednesday said they had no problem with the restrictions imposed by authorities. An elderly woman said she was happy that she could offer prayers to Lord Ayyappa. ""I have never had such a good opportunity to see the Lord,"" the beaming woman said. Another devotee said he had been coming to the shrine for the past 12 years. ""This year's was the most satisfying darshan,"" he said. Opposition leader in the state Assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, submitted a memorandum to Governor P Sathasivam, seeking his immediate intervention to withdraw prohibitory orders in Sabarimala and surrounding areas and restore peace in the hill shrine.

" Naga tribal organisations have asked the BJP's state unit, which backed out of a joint declaration for not contesting the Assembly polls, to come clean on whether it was committed to finding a solution to the vexed Naga political issue. The core committee of the Naga Tribal Hoho and Civil Organisations said the BJP should clarify its stand after the party backed out of the joint declaration as it has created confusion in the state. Representatives of 11 political parties, including the Naga People's Front, the BJP and the Congress, had decided on Monday to not contest the 27 February elections, agreeing to the demand of tribal bodies and civil society groups to resolve the Naga political problem first. State BJP president Visasolie Lhoungu had said that the party's central leadership will take a call on the matter. The BJP has suspended its state executive council member Kheto Semaparty, who had signed the joint declaration. ""The BJP cannot speak with forked tongue when even after signing the joint declaration, it has put in place a game plan to scuttle the voice of solution to Naga problem before the ensuing election"", core committee convener Theja Therieh and co-convener David Sangtam said in a statement here last night. They said: ""The party suspended its member for signing the historic declaration when he was authorised by none other than the state BJP president to sign on behalf of the party,"" and added, ""This treacherous act will not go unchallenged"". The state BJP chief had stated that he had asked Kheto to attend the meeting but had not authorised him to sign the joint declaration. ""We had authorised two party leaders to attend the meeting but had also said that if there is anything regarding the elections, the party's national leaders should be consulted,"" he said. Accusing the BJP of ""playing a dirty game"" to grab political power at the expense of Naga aspirations, they said it was exemplified by their slogan ""Election for Solution"". The core committee also wondered whether the state BJP members were Nagas first or their allegiance was to the party high command, rather than finding a solution to the Naga problem. ""The core committee representing all the apex tribal hohos (organisations) and mass-based civil societies would like to question whether the state BJP is committed to finding solution to the seven-decade-old Naga political issue"", the statement said. The core committee also demanded that the state BJP should revoke the suspension of their state executive member Kheto Sema who had signed the joint declaration. The statement said that unless the state BJP accedes to this demand, the core committee as per its 29 January resolution shall take necessary steps and the state BJP would be solely responsible for any aggravation of the situation in the state. Stating that since the Nagaland Assembly had taken a stand on 'Solution before Election' according to a resolution passed on 15 December, the core committee reminded the MLAs that it was now the time to resign from the Assembly and the need of the hour was to act rather than paying mere lip service. ""Such an act of collective sacrifice will definitely send a strong message to the central government that the Nagas desire a solution at the earliest,"" the core committee said.",PTI,PTI

Chidambaram also picked holes in the government's budgetary promise of providing insurance coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh to 10 crore poor families and said it was a ""big j "" (gimmick). ""The finance minister fails the fiscal consolidation test and this failure will have serious consequences,"" Chidambaram had told PTI earlier in the day, soon after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley completed his budget speech. The National Health Protection Scheme, announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget for 2018-19, will cover approximately 50 crore people. While lauding the healthcare protection schemes for the poor announced on Thursday, head honchos of leading private hospitals said their effective implementation was crucial. Zahabiya Khorakiwala, MD, Wockhardt Hospitals group, said the Suraksha Bima Yojana would ensure that almost 40 percent of underprivileged population is able to access secondary and tertiary care healthcare, and it would increase the market size for healthcare providers radically. ""The investment in hospitals is a subject matter of viability, so it is yet a bit premature to assess investment potential of the schemes announced. However, if the propositions are commercially viable, these would be opening a vast market for the investments to flow in,"" she told PTI.

": With just two days left before the adrenaline-charged campaign for the Karnataka Assembly elections comes to an end, the BJP and Congress, the two major contenders for power, fielded their top commanders, who attacked each other over corruption and hardline Hindutva. Leading the charge for the BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed people of Karnataka had decided to ""uproot"" the Congress and ""punish"" it for its wrongdoings, and that the party was already trying to find excuses like faulty EVMs for its ""impending"" defeat. Taking on the Siddaramaiah government over alleged corruption at the three rallies he addressed today, Modi said there was not even a single minister who was not facing accusations of financial irregularities. Campaigning in the Lingayat stronghold of Vijayapura, he alleged the state's ruling Congress was trying to divide the society and spread the ""poison of casteism"". Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked the BJP and RSS, likening them to the Islamist organisation Muslim Brotherhood, and saying their agenda was to come topower, and capture institutions. ""The BJP and RSS will repeat one more cycle of getting elected democratically and then discard democracy,"" he alleged in Bengaluru. ""The RSS over here and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt,Pakistan, Tunisia, Turkey....they are doing the same thing. The RSS and Muslim Brotherhood do not see elections the way we seethem. We win an election and we are okay with losing anelection,"" he said. Rahul, who earlier in the day said he was ready to occupy the post of the prime minister if the Congress emerged as the ""biggest"" party after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, claimed the saffron outfits were trying to disrupt open-mindedatmosphere, peace and the brotherhood that existed in India. He said the BJP praised Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and B R Ambekdar upfront but destroyed their legacy. ""Their method is to praise the leader, praise the icon,worship the icon and destroy every single thing he used todo,"" Rahul said. After a hiatus of two years, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi addressed an election rally in Vijayapura, hours after Modi's public meeting, and claimed the prime minister was ""possessed by the devil"" of Congress-mukt Bharat. His only accomplishment in the last four years was to have undone the good work of the previous Congress governments, she said. ""Modi ji is proud that he can make speeches well. I agree he is a good orator. He speaks like an actor. If speeches could fill the country's stomach, I wish he gave more speeches,"" she said, taking a swipe at the prime minister. Sonia Gandhi's rally in Vijayapura in north Karnataka, where Lingayats wield considerable electoral influence, was seen as an attempt to reach out to the community, which has traditionally backed the BJP. ""Modi ji has junoon (passion) of Congress mukt bharat. He is possessed by the devil of Congress mukt bharat (Congress mukht bharat ka bhoot laga hai), Sonia told the audience, as she attacked the prime minister for doing nothing for the middle class, women, girls, dalits and backward classes. Taking on the prime minister over steps to tackle corruption, she wanted to know why the Lokpal, the proposed anti-graft ombudsman, had not been constituted. Sonia claimed Congress-ruled Karnataka was discriminated against as it got ""too little"" by way of central assistance for drought relief. ""Modi ji, is this your sab ka saath, sab ka vikas? (together will all, development of all),"" she asked. Modi, who addressed rallies at Vijayapura, Koppal and Bengaluru, accused the Congress of pursuing the policy of ""divide and rule"". ""Congress believes in the policy of divide and rule... divide on the basis of caste and religion....make brother fight brother. But people of this land of Basaveshwara will not allow it to happen,"" he told the rally at Vijayapura. The state's ruling Congress has recommended religious minority status for the Lingayats, a traditional vote base of the BJP, a move many feel was aimed at splitting their votes. BJP's chief ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa belongs to the the Lingayat community. Modi said with defeat staring the Congress in the face, it was busy trying to find excuses like blaming the EVMs for the loss. He also said attempts were being made to confuse the voters with the claim that the elections will throw up a hung Assembly. ""Can you tell me the name of a single minister who is not facing allegations of corruption,"" he said targeting the Congress government, a day after Siddaramaiah sent legal notices to Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, threatening to file civil and criminal defamation suit against them for making unsubstantiated allegations.

"The Monsoon Session 2018 was filled with interesting discussions and iconic moments. Despite the anticipation of a stormy session because of Opposition's pitch for no-confidence motion, both Houses of Parliament managed to have 17 sittings spread across 24 days. As the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha adjourned sine die on Friday, here's a look at all the noteworthy moments from inside the two Houses. The debate during the no-confidence motion itself hosted many iconic moments from this Monsoon Session. Ofcourse, the Rahul-hugging-Modi scene, and the Congress president's wink that followed, are at the top of the list, but there were other moments, too, that deserve a mention. During his speech, Rahul accused the prime minister of ignoring the farmers and alleged that Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had lied about the Rafale deal under pressure from Modi. While making these allegations, Rahul looked at Modi and said that, "" He is smiling but he is nervous,"" Rahul said. Reacting to this, Modi widened his eyes in a bid to dismiss Rahul's claim. Rahul had also claimed that SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal was smiling as he made allegations against Modi. When Kaur took offense to him hugging Modi, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan questioned her objection, and said, ""What are you talking about? You were smiling (during Rahul's speech).""  Badal also asked Rahul what he “had” before coming to the House. While participating in a debate on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill on 31 July, TMC leader Saugata Roy sought to know in the Lok Sabha whether Piyush Goyal is the caretaker finance minister or the full-time finance minister. Deputy Speaker M Thambidurai said that Goyal had already asserted in the House that Arun Jaitley is the finance minister. Roy, however, pointed out that the amendment bill mentioned Goyal's name as the finance minister. ""At the back of the bill it is written, 'Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways, Finance, Corporate, Coal.' Why are you (Thambidurai) speaking on his behalf? I want to hear it from him."" On 7 August, when the Lower House was discussing The Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2018-19 and demands for excess grants for 2015-16, Roy again took a dig Goyal, saying he is the most burdened minister in the history of independent India. Goyal was given the additional charge of the finance ministry on 14 May when Arun Jaitley underwent a kidney transplant operation. Jaitley is expected to return to office by the end of August. On 24 July, the Centre ruled out giving special category status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh and said the bifurcated state had got a better deal. Home Minister Rajnath Singh was replying to a nearly four-hour debate in the Rajya Sabha on special category status to the residual state of Andhra Pradesh during which former prime minister Manmohan Singh took a veiled dig at his successor Narendra Modi. Manmohan Singh said the assurance to Andhra Pradesh was made by him on behalf of parliament and he expected it to be fulfilled by the government. Manmohan Singh said he had made a ""solemn commitment"" on the floor of the Rajya Sabha as prime minister for special category status to Andhra Pradesh. He said the commitment to Andhra Pradesh had been discussed with then leader of Opposition Arun Jaitley and other senior BJP leaders. ""(The) government is a continuing entity. Commitments made on the floor of the House have to be honoured and fulfilled. They are in nature of assurance on behalf of Parliament. I had expected my distinguished successor to fulfil the commitments I had made after consultations with his own colleagues."" Intervening in the debate, Goyal said the Andhra Re-organisation Act was being respected. ""The government remains committed to ensure the welfare of state of Andhra Pradesh and people of Andhra Pradesh."" Rajnath Singh said the BJP-led central government had fulfilled ""around 90 percent"" of the commitments made under the Andhra Act and was ""committed"" to fulfil the rest ""at any cost"". ""Our government will fulfil all the commitments made not only by our prime minister but also those made by former prime minister Manmohan Singh."" BJP president Amit Shah's remarks accusing the Opposition of allegedly trying to protect the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants caused disruption in the Rajya Sabha and subsequent adjournment of the House for the day on 31 July, as the Opposition expressed concern over the Assam NRC draft that leaves out over 40 lakh people. ""The Assam Accord was signed by your (Congress) prime minister Rajiv Gandhi on 14 August, 1985. And he announced it from the Red Fort in his speech the next day. The spirit of the Accord was the NRC that would help identify the Bangladeshi infiltrators,"" Shah said. ""You did not have the courage to implement it. We had the courage and we are doing it. Everybody here (in the Opposition) is concerned with the 40 lakh people. How many Bangladeshi infiltrators are there among these 40 lakh? Who do you want to protect?

Why is he taking notes? He is counting the number of MPs,"" Kharge said amidst vociferous protests by his party MPs.Kharge also claimed that as they were raising the issue, the officer concerned is seen leaving the House. The Speaker assured the agitated members and said she could not see the Officers' Gallery from her seat but she will look into the matter. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said the concerned officer belonged to his ministry and was doing his duty. HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said the Lok Sabha proceedings were telecast live and everyone can see what is happening in the House. ""People even now can see who is winking in the House,"" he said in an apparent dig at Rahul.

On his part, Harivansh assured the members that he will conduct the proceedings of the House in a non-partisan manner. ""Now I do not belong to any party,"" he said, seeking cooperation of the members in the smooth conduct of the House. He said that it was a matter of pride for him to reach the corridors of power and pledged to work for the country's development. After Harivansh's speech, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu invited him to conduct the House proceedings. On 9 August, the Lok Sabha witnessed a heated exchange between Goyal and Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, with the minister challenging Kharge to fight an election against him from Mumbai. Goyal, who was speaking on the four GST bills taken up by the House for passage, targeted Congress and said it will be reduced to a single digit in the next Lok Sabha elections. Kharge hit back saying the minister had not even won an election. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar sought an aplogy from Kharge over his remarks. Congress members were near the Speaker's podium and raising slogans in favour of their demand for a joint parliamentary committee to probe the Rafale fighter jet deal during Goyal's speech. As members of treasury benches protested, Kumar said the Kharge was a senior member but was ignorant of rules of procedure. ""Piyush Goyal   is elected to the other House. He has been elected by the States. He knows that, in the constitutional scheme made by Babasaheb Ambedkar, anybody can be elected to either of the two Houses of Parliament. Therefore, if this basic knowledge is not with Kharge  , then, he should apologize to the entire House. He should apologize to Piyush Goyal  ,"" Kumar said. The minister said senior former prime minister Manmohan Singh was also a Rajya Sabha member. ""They should remember Manmohan Singh, who is six-time MP from Assam, is still in the other House. We respect him for he became the prime minister of this country twice. The same question which Mallikarjun Kharge   is asking our friend Piyush Goyal should be posed to Manmohan Singh also,"" he said. Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned for the day on 8 August after paying obituary to DMK chief M Karunanidhi who passed away the day before. As soon as the Lok Sabha met for the day, the Speaker informed members of the demise of Karunanidhi. After observing a moment of silence in his memory, Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned for the day. In Rajya Sabha, Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, reading out an obituary reference, described Karunanidhi as a multifaceted personality and a gritty figure who overcame difficulties. Members stood in silence as a mark of respect to the departed soul. Naidu then adjourned the proceedings for the day. Prior to the commencement of proceedings of the day, Naidu consulted senior leaders of various political parties for their views on adjournment of proceedings of the House for the day. He sought to know views of leaders as there was no precedent of adjourning the House in case the departed leader was not a sitting or former member of the House, sources told  . Referring to Karunanidhi as one of the tallest leaders of the country, all members spoke in favour of adjournment of proceedings of the House as a mark of respect to the departed leader, they said. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Kumar said the government was also in favour of adjournment and the same was conveyed to the Lok Sabha Speaker as well.",FP Staff,FP Staff

" Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday accepted the resignations of two controversial BJP ministers, who had participated in a rally in support of the people arrested in connection with the rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in Kathua, officials said. The resignations of Chaudhary Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga were received from BJP state chief Sat Sharma this morning which were immediately accepted and forwarded to Governor NN Vohra for completing the procedural formalities, they said. With these resignations, the number of ministers in the state government has come down to 22, including nine from the BJP. There are three vacancies in the council of ministers as the PDP had last month removed its finance minister Haseeb Drabu unceremoniously, they said. BJP general secretary  , who had held consultations with legislators of the party in Jammu on Saturday, had announced the resignations would be forwarded for further action thereby ending a simmering political crisis in the state. Both Ganga and Singh had participated in a rally on 1 March after the crime branch of Jammu and Kashmir Police had arrested the nephew of a caretaker of a ' ' (temple) in connection with the kidnapping and rape of the little girl. During the investigation, the police arrested the caretaker and alleged he was the mastermind behind the kidnapping, rape and killing of the girl from a nomadic tribe. The police claimed the motive behind the crime was to terrify the nomadic community and drive it out of the village. The girl was kidnapped on 10 January and her body was found on 17 January. During the investigation, the crime branch alleged she was drugged and repeatedly raped before being killed by crushing her head with stones. Both the ministers had maintained on Saturday that they had been   to understand the ground situation. The two ministers were present at the rally in support of the rape-accused where the tricolour was also waved. Madhav had on Saturday said, ""That is why they had to resign. During my visit last month here, I made it clear to everyone that in this matter no one speaks and let us allow the investigations to complete."" ""Certain amount of discretion should have been maintained. Certainly, there was a lack of discretion. Sometimes a lack of discretion does not tantamount to any guilt...that has led to certain misconceptions about them (two ministers) also, so they decided they will quit as ministers,"" he had responded, when asked about the two ministers having termed the action of the crime branch as ""jungle raj"" and warned police from arresting anyone.

""I and my workers announce our resignation from the basic membership of the PDP,"" he told reporters. Khatana alleged the PDP had drifted off the path shown by Sayeed and had become a hub of corrupt and insensitive people. Accompanied by around 60 workers, Khatana said he had joined the party on the invitation of Sayeed in 2014 and wanted to address the problems of Gujjars and Bakerwals. After Sayeed's death in 2016, the PDP completely got off the track that he had laid down, he claimed.

" Posters surfaced in Patna on Wednesday depicting Congress president Rahul Gandhi and leaders of the party's Bihar unit as representatives of their respective caste groups. The BJP criticised the Congress over the development. The posters, wherein Gandhi and the AICC in-charge for the state Shaktisinh Gohil were thanked for constituting a new state Congress Committee and ""setting an example of social harmony"" therein, were put up at a number of places in the city. The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee was revamped last week with the appointment of new office-bearers. While Rahul Gandhi and Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Madan Mohan Jha were described as representing ""Brahmin community"", Gohil's image was labelled ""Rajput samuday"" (community). Images of campaign committee chairman and Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Congress Legislature Party leader Sadanand Singh were, similarly, labelled "" "" and "" "", respectively. The posters also had images of a few other prominent party leaders, with their respective caste groups mentioned thereon. While Congress leaders remained tight-lipped about the posters, BJP state spokesman Nikhil Anand urged the Election Commission to ""take note of the brazen attempt at playing the caste card ahead of the Lok Sabha polls"". ""In sheer desperation, the Congress has been resorting to gimmicks like proclaiming Rahul Gandhi as one who wears the sacred thread, worships Lord Shiva and goes to Kailash Mansarovar on pilgrimage. The posters mark a new low in the history of the Congress which Mahatma Gandhi had, rightly, wished to abolish after Independence.

Gogoi said that his outfit would not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as he wanted to take time to develop a proper political understanding and create “a strong network”.

" A Panchkula court has framed charges against 41 people in connection with the violence that followed the conviction last year of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, but dropped sedition clauses. The charges have been framed for rioting, attempt to murder, use of explosive substances (under the Explosive Substances Act) and damaging public property (under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act), defence counsel Suresh Rohilla said on Thursday. He said the court of Additional Sessions Judge Neerja Kulwant Kalson framed charges against the accused on Tuesday. However, sedition charges against them have been dropped, he said. ""As the state government denied sanction for slapping sedition charges against the accused, the court has dropped sedition charges against all 41 in connection with FIR no 333,"" he said. Senior Dera functionaries including Chamkaur Singh, Govind Ram Insan and Surinder Dhiman Insan are among the 41 accused, he said. ""We had submitted before the court that for prosecuting the accused under Sections 121, 121-A and 122 of IPC, the sanction has not been accorded by the state government,"" he said.

"Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar appointed Prashant Kishor as the party's vice president on Tuesday, effectively making him the second most powerful person in the party over a month after he joined it. Having worked for a number of parties as a poll strategist, Kishor has emerged as a trusted aide to the Bihar chief minister who would count on his relations across party lines and campaign skills to steer the JD(U) to success in the Lok Sabha polls. Party spokesperson KC Tyagi said Kishor's appointment would help it reach out to social segments outside its traditional support base as he counted his skills and past track record as a valuable asset for the Bihar-based party. ""He will help the party chart a new course outside the traditional methods of socialist politics"", Tyagi said. However, the rapid rise of Kishor, who is in his early 40s, is likely to cause heartburn among JD(U)'s senior leaders as Kumar has come to rely increasingly on him for managing the party's political affairs. Kishor was associated with the successful prime ministerial bid of Narendra Modi during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Feeling sidelined, he then worked for the JD(U)-Rashtriya Janata Dal-Congress grand alliance in Bihar, which delivered the BJP a humiliating defeat in the 2015 Assembly polls. He consequently worked for the Congress in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. However, Kishor was seen to be warming up to the BJP again with reports that he had met its senior leaders.

" The Election Commission in a press conference confirmed that the voter ID cards seized were genuine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed crowd in Bidar. Modi again attacked the Congress in Belagavi and said that the party had insulted democracy by being involved in the 'fake' voter ID row. BJP alleged that the Congress' habit of engaging in deals had been exposed with the 'fake' voter ID row coming out. In Chikmaglur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi charged the Congress with attempting to rig the polls. ""They have created fake voter IDs to massively rig the Karnataka election. The people of Karnataka should resolve never to forgive such a party,"" he said. Reacting to Modi's ""remote control with Sonia Gandhi"" jibe against the Congress, Anand Sharma said, ""Everybody knows who has the remote control in this government."" Addressing a press conference, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said, ""Congress is blatantly lying (about BJP's connection with the voter IDs found in a Bengaluru apartment). Our worker Rakesh is the whistleblower, but Manjula and her son are not our party workers."" A Congress delegation led by senior leader Anand Sharma delegation has arrived at Election Commission's office in Delhi over ""fake"" voter IDs recovered in Bengaluru. Interacting with women factory workers in Bengaluru, Congress president Rahul Gandhi addressed the issue of unemployment due to closure of small businesses. ""In India, 90 percent of money in the banks goes to selected 10-15 people. How many people did Nirav Modi employ? He didn't employ anyone, but the banks gave him Rs 33,000 crore to him,"" he said. In Bangarapet, Modi lashed out at Rahul over his aspiration to become the prime minister. ""How can someone just declare himself as the prime minister? This is simply nothing but arrogance,"" Modi said. A political slugfest erupted in Karnataka after the Election Commission confirmed that 9,746 voter IDs were seized from an apartment in Bengaluru. The BJP and Congress accused each other of interfering in the election process, and are both seeking to approach the poll panel over the issue. Rahul said on Twitter that Congress vs BJP is a ""no contest"" in Karnataka. Apart from addressing three rallies on Wednesday, Rahul will visit two temples and a garment factory. Modi is scheduled to attend public meetings in Bangarapet, Chikmagalur, Belagavi, and Bidar on Wednesday. BJP national president Amit Shah is scheduled to address one public meeting and hold roadshows in five constituencies on Wednesday. With just two days left before the adrenaline-charged campaign for the Karnataka Assembly elections comes to an end, the BJP and Congress, the two major contenders for power, fielded their top commanders, who attacked each other over corruption and hardline Hindutva. Leading the charge for the BJP, Modi claimed people of Karnataka had decided to ""uproot"" the Congress and ""punish"" it for its wrongdoings, and that the party was already trying to find excuses like faulty EVMs for its ""impending"" defeat. Taking on the Siddaramaiah government over alleged corruption at the three rallies he addressed today, Modi said there was not even a single minister who was not facing accusations of financial irregularities. Campaigning in the Lingayat stronghold of Vijayapura, he alleged the state's ruling Congress was trying to divide the society and spread the ""poison of casteism"". Rahul attacked the BJP and RSS, likening them to the Islamist organisation Muslim Brotherhood, and saying their agenda was to come to power, and capture institutions. ""The BJP and RSS will repeat one more cycle of getting elected democratically and then discard democracy,"" he alleged in Bengaluru. ""The RSS over here and the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt,Pakistan, Tunisia, Turkey....they are doing the same thing. The RSS and Muslim brotherhood do not see elections the way we seethem. We win an election and we are okay with losing anelection,"" he said. Rahul, who earlier in the day said he was ready to occupy the post of the prime minister if the Congress emerged as the ""biggest"" party after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, claimed the saffron outfits were trying to disrupt open-minded atmosphere, peace and the brotherhood that existed inIndia. He said the BJP praised Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and BR Ambekdar upfront but destroyed their legacy. ""Their method is to praise the leader, praise the icon,worship the icon and destroy every single thing he used to do,"" Rahul said. After a hiatus of two years, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi addressed an election rally in Vijayapura, hours after Modi's public meeting, and claimed the prime minister was ""possessed by the devil"" of Congress-mukt Bharat. His only accomplishment in the last four years was to have undone the good work of the previous Congress governments, she said. ""Modi   is proud that he can make speeches well. I agree he is a good orator. He speaks like an actor. If speeches could fill the country's stomach, I wish he gave more speeches,"" she said, taking a swipe at the prime minister. Sonia Gandhi's rally in Vijayapura in north Karnataka, where Lingayats wield considerable electoral influence, was seen as an attempt to reach out to the community, which has traditionally backed the BJP. ""Modi ji has   (passion) of Congress-   . He is possessed by the devil of Congress-  (Congres ), Sonia told the audience, as she attacked the prime minister for doing nothing for the middle class, women, girls, dalits and backward classes. Taking on the prime minister over steps to tackle corruption, she wanted to know why the Lokpal, the proposed anti-graft ombudsman, had not been constituted. Sonia claimed Congress-ruled Karnataka was discriminated against as it got ""too little"" by way of central assistance for drought relief. ""Modi ji, is this your ' s'? (together will all, development of all),"" she asked. Modi, who addressed rallies at Vijayapura, Koppal and Bengaluru, accused the Congress of pursuing the policy of ""divide and rule"". ""Congress believes in the policy of divide and rule... divide on the basis of caste and religion....make brother fight brother. But people of this land of Basaveshwara will not allow it to happen,"" he told the rally at Vijayapura. The state's ruling Congress has recommended religious minority status for the Lingayats, a traditional vote base of the BJP, a move many feel was aimed at splitting their votes. 
BJP's chief ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa belongs to the the Lingayat community. Modi said with defeat staring the Congress in the face, it was busy trying to find excuses like blaming the EVMs for the loss. He also said attempts were being made to confuse the voters with the claim that the elections will throw up a hung Assembly. ""Can you tell me the name of a single minister who is not facing allegations of corruption,"" he said targeting the Congress government, a day after Siddaramaiah sent legal notices to Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, threatening to file civil and criminal defamation suit against them for making unsubstantiated allegations. BJP president Amit Shah, who held a road show in Mangaluru and also addressed a rally, said the Congress government led by Siddaramaiah would be ""sent home"" on 15 May, the day the results would be declared.

" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday challenged the Congress to make someone from outside the Gandhi family its chief for at least five years if it respected democracy, as he returned the Congress' barb that a  could rise to power only because of democratic systems established by Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru. In an apparent attack on the Gandhi family, Modi also said that the Gandhi family, of which four generations have previously ruled the country, cannot fathom how the son of a poor mother can sit on the   (throne). Addressing a poll rally in Chhattisgarh's Surguja district for the second phase of the state assembly elections scheduled for 20 November, Modi also hit back at the Congress for questioning demonetisation, saying the move ""still rankles"" them as the money ""stashed under beds and in sacks"" was taken away in a single stroke. While the BJP has been ruling Chhattisgarh for 15 continuous years, the Congress was in power in the state only for three years after the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000. Traditionally, the two national parties have had a direct fight in this state, although a third force as emerged this time in form of an alliance between the parties of former Congress chief minister Ajit Jogi and of Dalit leader Mayawati. Modi asked Congress to give account of what the four generations of the (Gandhi) family did for the nation before asking for an account of his government's four-and-half years' rule. ""Four generations of the Congress ruled the counry, but they have nothing to tell the people. We are everyday giving an account of what we have done in the last four years,"" he said. ""They (Congress leaders) are saying it was due to a great person, due to Pandit Nehru, that a 'chaiwala' (tea seller) became the prime minister,"" Modi said. ""If you so much respect the democracy, do a small thing. If you claim that because of your principles, your faith in democracy, the Constitution and Pandit Nehru, Modi, a chaiwala, could become the PM, appoint someone good from outside the (Gandhi) family as the Congress president for just five years,"" he said. ""If this happens, I will accept that Nehru ji created such a democratic system because of which anyone, (even) a dedicated Congressman outside the family could become the Congress chief,"" he added. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had said that it was due to the institutional structures created by Nehru that even a  could become India's prime minister. His party colleague Mallikarjun Kharge had also said earlier that a   could become the prime minister as the Congress preserved democracy. Sitaram Kesri had served as the Congress president in the 1990s, but his tenure from September 1996 to March 1998 was less than five years. Rahul Gandhi is currently president of the Congress party, while the post was held by his mother Sonia Gandhi before that. A Congress president mostly gets a three-year term, though there have been exceptions. Continuing his barbs at the Gandhi family, Modi said the ""contract of democracy"" in the country was not given to one family, but they felt the Britishers had named India after it. ""They still keep crying that how could a chaiwala sit (on the PM's chair). How could he? They still cannot fathom how come the son of a poor mother could sit on the throne"" he said. Stating that such people cannot understand difficulties faced by the poor, but a chaiwala can, he said the credit for making a 'chaiwala' the prime minister goes to 125 crore Indians and not to Modi or the BJP. The prime minister also took on Rahul Gandhi for attacking him over demonetisation, saying only one ""family"" is ""crying"" over the note-ban exercise. ""No one from those sitting here (in the rally) is crying over demonetisation, but only one family is crying. Their associates lost their illegally earned money filled in bags, hidden inside their bed and pillow after demonetisation,"" the prime minister said. Modi also said Chhattisgarh was created peacefully during the tenure of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in contrast to violence during agitations for bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh under the Congress rule. He said the BJP is the only unbiased party and it is guided by the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', while the Congress kept the country in dark with lies that are ingrained in their minds. He also hailed the high voter turnout in the first phase of polling held in the state on 12 November for 18 seats, which covered Maoist-affected constituencies, saying the people of Bastar gave a strong response to Naxals by registering record voting percentage in the first phase. Despite threats given by Naxals to chop off fingers of those who will vote, tribals came out in large numbers to vote, he said. Modi urged voters of the remaining 72 assembly seats to show the same enthusiasm in the second phase on 20 November. Counting of votes for both phases would be held on 11 December. He said election offers the best opportunity to ""punish"" those who think it is the right of only one family to rule the country. ""When I had come to Ambikapur during last Lok Sabha elections, people had made a replica of Red Fort for my rally which annoyed a few people in Delhi as they thought it was the right of only one family to speak from Red Fort.

"After failing to meet with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah to discuss their displeasure over the seat-sharing arrangement in Bihar, Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha said his party has decided not to accept the seats offered by the BJP for the 2019 elections. He further said that he would no longer push for a meeting with anyone from the BJP, save for PM Narendra Modi. Earlier in the day, Kushwaha had said that the seat-sharing arrangement among the ruling NDA constituents in Bihar was “disrespectful to his party”, and warned that a continued rift over seats would be detrimental to the NDA. He said that he had attempted to negotiate with BJP president Amit Shah over the seat sharing arrangement but to no avail. He had added that his party was willing to wait till 30 November before deciding on further action. “I will also try and meet PM Narendra Modi to seek his intervention,” Kushwaha added. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's ""insulting remark” on Kushwaha was also discussed in his party's meeting in Patna on Saturday. The RLSP leader attended his party's state executive meeting, and BJP sources said any meeting between the two leaders before that is unlikely. Kushwaha had left for Delhi from Patna on Thursday, tweeting that he had sought an appointment with Shah to discuss the issue of seat-sharing and also his alleged humiliation by Kumar. Speaking to reporters in the national capital, Kushwaha claimed that his party wanted its share of seats in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 to be commensurate with its ""increased"" strength compared to the 2014 polls when it had contested on three seats. The BJP has indicated that it is unlikely to spare more than two seats for him. Kushwaha also repeated his allegation that Kumar had called him ' ' (lowly). He had responded to a journalist's query about Kushwaha's claim that Kumar did not want to continue as chief minister after the 2020 Assembly polls. The RLSP leader alleged that Kumar referred to him as ' ', a charge vehemently denied by the JD(U) which also released videos of the event. He also claimed that Kumar wants to destroy his party. The RLSP chief's aggressive comments against Kumar and his attack on Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi for defending of the CM has signalled his growing isolation in the coalition. Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party is another National Democratic Alliance constituent besides the BJP, JD(U) and RLSP. Mercurial RLSP leader Nagamani echoed the prevailing mood on the eve of the meeting with a cryptic remark, ""There will be a big explosion in a day or two"". However, a senior party indicated that the RLSP will not pull the plug on NDA and wait for the BJP's response. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

"“After the election results on 15 May, Congress will turn into PPP Congress – Punjab, Puducherry and Parivar Congress”, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally in poll-bound Karnataka’s Gadag district on Saturday, 5 May, ANI reported. Launching a blistering attack on the Congress, Modi alleged the presence of a ""tender system"" in the party for distributing tickets, selecting leaders and also appointing ministers, the report added. The prime minister cited the Mahadayi water dispute – between the states of Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra – as an example of Congress’ lies. Alleging that corruption is key to their existence, he said that the Congress is not worried about the depletion of natural resources till the time their coffers are full, ANI reported.

" Srishti Tyagi Vivek Gupta A staunch RSS ideologue, a hard boiled organisation man, Bengaluru's ""most loved"" MP and the first person to speak in Kannada in the United Nations are some of the connotations associated with Union Minister Ananth Kumar. Kumar passed away in the wee hours of Monday, 12 November, in Bengaluru’s Shankara’s Cancer Hospital. He held the Chemicals and Fertilizers and Parliamentary Affairs portfolio in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet. Known for his political skill, Kumar, a six-time member of Parliament, had managed to be in the inner circle of the central leadership of the BJP, be it during the heydays of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani and now Narendra Modi. Graduate in Arts and Law, Kumar's journey into public life began due to his association with the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student organisation of the Sangh Parivar, which he served in various capacities, including state secretary and national secretary. Kumar had demonstrated against the then Indira Gandhi government's imposition of Emergency and had also got imprisoned for it for about 30 days. Looking for bigger ground in politics, Kumar joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1987, where he went on to take up the responsibilities of state secretary, state president of the Yuva Morcha, general secretary and national secretary. Along with state BJP chief Yeddyurappa, Kumar is among a few party leaders who can be credited for the growth of BJP in Karnataka, as they built the party from the scratch, which paved the way for the installation of the first-ever saffron party government in the south. Kumar began his parliamentary career when he got elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 from Bangalore South, the constituency which remained his bastion till his passing away. Kumar, who also held positions in various parliamentary committees, was serving as the Union Cabinet Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Chemicals and Fertilizers in the Narendra Modi-led government, after winning the 15th Lok Sabha election from Bengaluru south by defeating IT czar Nandan Nilekani. While being a member of the BJP's parliamentary board, Kumar was often regarded as the ""Delhi face"" of the Karnataka BJP who could be counted upon for taking up issues concerning Karnataka. Kumar is married to Dr Tejaswini and they have two daughters Aishwarya and Vijetha. Kumar is the chief patron of Adamya Chetana, an NGO involved in social work which he runs along with his wife in the memory of his mother Girija Shastry. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" The Calcutta High Court on Friday quashed the State Election Commission's (SEC) order cancelling the notification for extension of deadline for filing nomination for panchayat polls in West Bengal and directed it to allow nominations by issuing a fresh notification. Justice Subrata Talukdar held that petitions, filed by the BJP, CPM and other Opposition parties, challenging the cancellation of notification are maintainable and asked the poll panel to issue fresh notification extending the date for filing nominations. The court directed the commission to reschedule the dates for panchayat election process and accordingly conduct the polls. The panchayat elections in West Bengal were to be held in three phases from 1 May to 5 May and the counting of votes was scheduled on 8 May. The nomination process for the panchayat polls ended on 9 April, but it was extended by a day by the SEC the same evening following a Supreme Court court order on petitions alleging that candidates backed by Opposition parties were being prevented from filing nominations. The West Bengal government and ruling Trinamool Congress had objected to the extension by the SEC, which had cited a Supreme Court direction to ""allay apprehensions of intending candidates"" in its notification extending the nomination process by a day. The notification, which referred to the apex court order, was withdrawn by the SEC on 10 April morning.

"The Bombay high court today admitted a plea filed by lieutenant colonel Prasad Shrikant Purohit, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, challenging previous judgements of the high court and a special trial court that had rejected his discharge from the case. On December 18, 2017, the high court had refused to quash a government sanction that permitted Purohit’s prosecution in the blast case. Earlier on December 27, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court had dismissed his plea to discharge him from the case. Purohit then approached the Supreme Court, and based on the apex court’s directions, approached the high court again earlier this year arguing that the sanction granted by the government to prosecute him in the case, was wrong in law. A prior sanction for Purohit’s prosecution was required since he was a serving Army officer at the time. On 17 January 2009, this sanction was issued by the additional chief secretary of the Maharashtra home department. Purohit’s lawyer Shrikant Shivde, however, has maintained that under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), the state law and judiciary department, which is the sanctioning authority, has to constitute an appropriate authority and seek its report first. In his case, the sanction was given in January 2009 but the authority was appointed only in October 2010, he has argued. Shivde has maintained that the sanction in Purohit’s case thus was not valid under the provisions of the UAPA and hence, courts couldn’t have taken cognisance of the charges against him. In the hearing conducted today, a bench consisting Justices Ranjit More and Anuja Prabhudessai, admitted the plea and said arguments over sanction will be heard from July 16. The National Investigating Agency, the prosecution in the case, had earlier opposed Purohit’s plea. NIA counsel, advocate Sandesh Patil, had argued that as per procedure, Purohit must file a fresh plea before the special court seeking discharge on the point of sanction. The bench also suggested that the NIA refrain from proceeding with the trial in the special court until the issue of sanction vide Purohit’s plea was decided by the high court. Patil, however, told the bench today that while the special NIA court had scheduled the framing of charges in the case for today, it was unlikely that the same would happen since the NIA court wasn’t “ready yet”. Six persons were killed and over a 100 were injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon in Maharashtra, on September 29, 2008. On December 27 last year, a special NIA court had dismissed pleas filed by Purohit, his co-accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, and six others seeking that they be discharged from the case. It had, however, given them partial relief by dropping all charges against them under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

With less than 24 hours to go before voting for the Assembly polls begin in Karnataka, here is a look at some of the lesser-known leaders who made an impact during this election: The BJP chief ministerial candidate, BS Yeddyurappa's announcement that his son   the Karnataka polls from Varuna constituency in Mysuru against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's son Yatindra, had triggered angry protests from party workers that led to a police lathicharge. Yeddyurappa had made the announcement at a meeting organised by the party at Nanjanagudu near Mysuru, just a day before the deadline for filing of nominations ended on 23 April. Soon after the unexpected announcement, angry BJP workers flung chairs and other furniture and raised slogans against party president Amit Shah and even tried to stop the cars of Vijayendra and other leaders as they were leaving. The saffron party instead announced Vijayendra as the   to appease both father, son and their supporters. Vijayendra had been campaigning heavily in Varuna and had rented a house there too, ahead of the decision. However, according to  Yeddyurappa had ""banished"" Vijayendra from his home in November 2010 when the former was the Karnataka chief minister. As per the report, the move sought to salvage Yeddyurappa's image in the eyes of the BJP central leadership, which was upset with him over charges of nepotism. The head of the Congress social media cell, Divya Spandana aka Ramya is the person behind Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's sharp and acerbic attacks on top BJP leaders, including Modi, Shah, Yeddyurappa, and others. The Kannada actor-turned-politician is an active Twitter user who contested and lost the 2014 polls from Mandya. She was appointed as the party's social media head in 2017. Her efforts marked the arrival of the Congress on social media, with an emphasis towards state-level leaders interacting with voters through the virtual world, reported  Several fact check videos that the Congress regularly puts out on its official Twitter handle, are Spandana's initiative. “The one-line brief Rahul gave me when I was picked to lead the social media cell was to stick to the truth and nothing but the truth,""  quoted her as saying. When it comes to Badami, most people are focused on the tough battle it will be between Siddaramaiah and BJP's deputy chief ministerial candidate B Sreeramulu, the JD(S) candidate Hanumanthappa Mavinamarad is keen to make it a triangular fight. The 38-year-old is the son of a Lingayat farmer who left the Congress a year ago and joined JD(S). While both Siddaramaiah and Sreeramulu have been running high decibel campaigns, Mavinamarad has been low-key yet consistent, according to  He is a well-known face in the town and can be approached by anybody at any time of the day. He reportedly began his campaign a year ago and personally went knocking on 45,000 of the 60,000 doors in Badami. Set to make his political debut on 12 May, pathologist Yathindra S, Siddaramaiah's son will be contesting the Karnataka polls from Varuna constituency. A newbie on the state political scene, Yathindra has been visiting different parts of his constituency for the last 18 months. He was compelled to step in after his older brother Rakesh Siddaramaiah, considered the chief minister's political heir, died in July 2016. In the same year, he was embroiled in a corruption scandal where it was alleged that Yathindra was favoured in a tender given to set up labs at the state-run Victoria Hospital in Bengaluru, where he was a director, reported  While he has maintained that the Congress ""will win comfortably"", the fact that Yeddyurappa's son Vijayendra was pulled out of the polls at the last minute  .

According to the report, days after Rohith committed suicide in his hostel room, the IUML had promised his mother Radhika Rs 20 lakh to build a house for the family, which now stays in rented accommodation. The proposal came from the Muslim Students Federation (MSF), a student organisation close to the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), which Rohith was a part of.

He told the workers that the BJP had reached the ""pinnacle of success"", but its target would only be achieved when it attained power in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal. Shah claimed that the presence of nearly one lakh booth-level workers and their eagerness showed that the BJP would win 65-plus seats in the forthcoming state Assembly polls. ""From 10 members, the party has grown to 11 crore members, becoming the world's largest party. We have 1,800 MLAs, 330 MPs, governments in 19 states and a government at the Centre with full majority.

Former CPM central committee member and Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee felt that the decision of not going for an adjustment with the Congress will prove to be another blunder in the future. ""I feel very sad after seeing what is happening. The party has committed many blunders from not allowing Jyoti Basu to become Prime Minister in 1996, to not joining the government in 2004. This will be another blunder,"" he said. ""We have a clear understanding about the menace of the BJP. The Tripura unit is also having a taste of the BJP's divisive politics. But despite attacks of the RSS, the Kerala unit is yet to understand the magnitude of the threat the BJP poses,"" a CPM central committee member said on condition of anonymity. Although the CPM is divided over adjustment with the Congress, its allies like the CPI are in favour of broader unity of secular forces including the Congress. ""We feel that there should be broader unity of secular and democratic forces including Congress to stop the march of BJP,"" CPI leader D Raja said. Other Left allies the RSP and the Forward Bloc are yet to take a call on this issue.

The two suits were filed by Reliance Defence, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Aerostructure, which belong to Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group.

"If there is a common thread in campaign theme of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the BJP in the 7 December Assembly polls, it's certainly their unsparing attack on the Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu. The pre-poll pact of TDP — the ruling party of the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh — and the Congress for election to the 119-member Telangana Assembly, has also come under fire by the TRS and BJP, which have repeatedly dubbed it ""unholy"". After all, how can TDP, a party formed in 1982 by actor-turned-politician NTR on an anti-Congress plank and to uphold Telugu self-respect in 1982, join hands with the very outfit, they ask. TRS and BJP leaders allege that if the Congress-TDP alliance comes to power in Telangana, it would be Naidu who would be calling the shots from the Andhra Pradesh capital of Amaravati. Congress and TDP leaders strongly counter their arguments, saying they joined forces to fight the ""divisive and destructive politics"" of the BJP and end the ""misrule"" of the TRS government, which let all sections of people down with its ""false promises."" ""Congress is sold out to TDP,"" Telangana BJP spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao claimed, and alleged that Telangana Congress was being run by Naidu. ""Candidates of the Congress-TDP alliance are being dictated by Naidu. He seems to be the chief sponsor of Telangana Congress Party both financially and also administratively,"" he said. If there is a possibility of formation of government under Congress, then the de-facto chief minister will be in Andhra Pradesh, not in Telangana. And Chandrababu Naidu will be running Telangana through remote control with his de-facto powers, Rao alleged. TDP spokesperson Lanka Dinakar reminded the TRS that it had an alliance with TDP in the 2009 elections in the undivided Andhra Pradesh. Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014. 
TDP was formed in Hyderabad, now capital of Telangana, he recalled. Describing as ""political gimmick"" the TRS contention that Naidu opposed irrigation projects in Telangana, Dinakar said the K Chandrasekhar Rao government, instead, should tell people what development and welfare measures they initiated during their tenure. He claimed that there has been no problem between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on sharing of water resources, and charged the BJP-led NDA with delaying resolution of procedural issues for political gains. On TRS-BJP's allegation that Naidu would ""control"" Telangana's affairs if Congress-TDP alliance comes to power, Dinakar dismissed it as ""inconceivable"". Those who make such a charge have no respect for federal spirit, constitution and democratic values, he said. Senior Congress leader Marri Shashidhar Reddy, also former Vice-Chairman of National Disaster Management Authority, defended the Congress-TDP electoral pact, saying the alliance was a ""compulsion"" and need of the hour. On charges that Naidu was putting hurdles on Telangana irrigation projects, Reddy, son of former Chief Minister Marri Chenna Reddy, told PTI that Telangana people have been opposing AP's Polavaram project. ""These are all things which were different situation altogether. When we (Congress-TDP) come together (to form government), there will be a common agenda, there will be a common understanding. What happened in the past cannot prevent us from moving ahead. We will come out with common agenda. If any aberration of the past, will not be repeated,"" he said. Reddy, Chairman of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee's Election Commission Coordination Committee, said the BJP is panicky about the moves made in the last few days by Naidu to bring together all forces opposed to the BJP. ""The alliance is to save the people from misrule.... falsehood... promises, people of all sections feel let down,"" he said. ""It's a compulsion and need of the hour. It's to fight divisive and destructive politics (of the BJP).""

"The Rashtriya Muslim Manch, which is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, on Tuesday said the Hindutva organisation was well within its rights to refuse to host an Iftar party at its headquarters in Nagpur,   reported. The Rashtriya Muslim Manch was responding to discontent in its Maharashtra unit over the RSS’ refusal to hold such a party after a request by one of its office bearers “Islam does not ask someone else to host the party for Muslims,” said the Manch’s President Mohammad Afzal. “The request by the Maharashtra unit leader at Nagpur to the RSS is fundamentally flawed on this count and he has been told about it.” Afzal pointed out that Muslims follow a different diet during Ramzan,   reported. “We eat meat and eggs, this cultural aspect should have also been kept in mind,” he said. “There is no such cultural link. Also it makes no sense, even Muslims would not open their doors for someone’s religious gathering.”  The controversy erupted last week when the convener of the Manch’s Maharashtra unit, Mohammad Faruq Sheikh, made the request to Rajesh Loya, the RSS’ Nagpur city unit chief. The RSS leader, however, turned it down.  “I thought RSS hosting Iftar would send a message of brotherhood at a time the world is talking about growing intolerance in India,” Sheikh said. “What is wrong in that? Last year, we had hosted an Iftar party in front of Mominpura’s Jama Masjid, in which some RSS and BJP leaders had come.”",Scroll Staff,Scroll Staff

" Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal saying 'services' matter lies with the Council of ministers after officers refused to follow the AAP dispensation's order withdrawing powers of transfer and postings from the L-G. The letter comes a day after the Supreme Court in its verdict on the power tussle between the Delhi government and the Centre clipped the powers of the L-G. The AAP government now plans to issue an order regarding the implementation of public welfare schemes and the court's verdict to all its functionaries. In his letter to Baijal, the chief minister said that L-G's concurrence would now not be required on any matter, adding all stakeholders need to work towards implementing the apex court's order in ""letter and spirit"". Hours after the Supreme Court's landmark judgement on Wednesday, the government introduced a new system for transfer and postings of bureaucrats, making Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal the approving authority. However, the services department refused to comply, saying the Supreme Court did not abolish the 21 May, 20 15 notification of Ministry of Home Affairs according to which services matters lies with the lieutenant governor. The AAP government and the bureaucracy are likely to move towards another round of tussle on the issue of services matter if both sides remain firm on their stand. 
""Executive power related to 'services' lies with COM (council of ministers),"" Kejriwal said in the letter, citing extracts from the Supreme Court's order. ""It is clear... that Central government/LG have executive powers only on three subjects. On all other subjects, executive powers lay with the COM,"" he said. The MHA's notification has become ""infructuous"" in light of such clear orders of the apex court, the chief minister said, adding the court judgement has become effective the moment it was pronounced. In his letter to the L-G, Kejriwal said, ""We seek your (L-G's) support for the development of Delhi, for implementing public welfare schemes and for the implementation of the Supreme Court. We plan to issue orders tomorrow to all functionaries of Delhi government on the above lines."" ""In case you have contrary views on any of the above issues, kindly do let me know. If you so desire, myself and my cabinet colleagues can come over for a discussion,"" he said. Earlier in the day, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that if officers are not going to abide by the apex court's order and if the L-G still keeps seeing transfer files then it will amount to contempt of the Constitution Bench. The Supreme Court in its verdict on Wednesday said the L-G has no ""independent decision-making power"" and has to act on the aid and advice of the elected government. The order by a five-judge constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, laid down broad parameters for the governance of the national capital, which has witnessed a bitter power tussle between the Centre and Delhi government since the AAP government first came to power in 2014.",Press Trust of India,FP Staff

The senior Opposition leader quoted verses to heap praise on Vajpayee and said he was such an eloquent speaker that even his criticism sounded pleasant whereas, he added, there are some leaders who, even when they say something good, make it sound like abuses.

Today what is happening in the country is that, they are doing whatever they feel like.” Earlier in the day, the Pune police raided the homes of prominent Left-wing activists in several states and arrested at least five of them for “suspected Maoist links”. The raids were carried out as part of a probe into the clashes between Dalits and right-wing activists at Koregaon- Bhima village near Pune after an event called Elgar Parishad, or conclave, on December 31 last year.

"The Supreme Court on May 7 struck down the amendment to a Uttar Pradesh legislation which allows former chief ministers of the state to retain government accommodation even after demitting office. A bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi said the amendment in the legislation was ultra vires to the Constitution since it transgresses the concept of equality under the constitution. The bench said the amendment was “arbitrary, discriminatory” and violates the concept of equality. The apex court said that once such persons demit public office, there is nothing to distinguish them from the common man. The apex court had on April 19 reserved its verdict on an NGO’s plea challenging amendments to the UP legislation allowing ex-chief ministers of the state to continue occupying government bungalows. The top court had earlier observed that if the provision, which has been challenged by NGO Lok Prahari, was held invalid, then similar legislation in other states might also come under challenge. The NGO had challenged the amendments made by the erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government to the UP Ministers (Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1981. It had also challenged another UP law of 2016 called ‘The Allotment of Houses under Control of the Estate Department Bill-2016’ to regulate the allotment of government accommodation to trusts, journalists, political parties, speaker and deputy speaker of legislative assembly, judicial officers and government officials.",PTI,PTI

" CPM leader Brinda Karat on Saturday said her party is in-principle against death penalty and the actual issue is that those in the government are ""defending the rapists"". Her comment came on a day the Union Cabinet approved an ordinance to provide stringent punishment, including death penalty, for those convicted of rape of girls below 12 years, amid a nation-wide outrage over cases of sexual assault and murder of minors in Kathua and Surat, and the rape of a girl in Unnao. ""Already on our statute books death penalty is there for the rarest of rare cases. In-principle, my party, the CPI (M), is against death penalty,"" Karat said. ""The actual problem is not that there is no death penalty for child rape. The actual issue here is those in government are defending the rapists,"" she said. In an apparent reference to the lawyers' protest attempting to obstruct filing of charge sheet in Kathua rape-and-murder case, she said, ""We have heard about the BJP being 'gau rakshaks' but now they are rapist 'rakshaks'. The penalty should be against the rapist 'rakshaks'."" In Hyderabad, where the CPM party congress is being held, she said, ""This (the ordinance) is to divert the attention from the grievous nature of the assault on basic judicial processes, where even the lawyers try to stop the police from filing charge sheet.

"People in Delhi will get doorstep delivery of 40 government services, including obtaining a marriage certificate, driving license and new water connection, from Monday, an official said. However, a five-judge Constitution Bench had on July 4 laid down broad parameters for governance of the national capital, paving the way for the government to proceed with the scheme. ""Doorstep delivery of services. A revolution in governance. A big blow to corruption. Super convenience for people. Happening for the first time anywhere in the world.

According to the plan, Mobile Sahayaks (facilitators) will be hired through the agency that would set up call centres. If a person wants to apply for driving licence, he or she would have to call a designated call centre and give the details. Thereafter, the agency would assign a Mobile Sahayak, who will visit the applicant's residence and get the required details and documents.

"Virtually laying down the terms for an alliance with non-BJP parties for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BSP chief Mayawati on Sunday, 16 September, demanded a “respectable share of seats” failing which, she said, her party will go it alone. “The BSP might be compelled to go it alone if it does not get a respectable number of seats in the anti-BJP alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said. This is our clear cut stand, she said at a press conference held for the first time in her new accommodation in Lucknow after she was forced to vacate a sprawling government bungalow following Supreme Court orders. About the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the upcoming Assembly elections in certain states, Mayawati said, “The effort of the opposition parties will be to stop the BJP from coming to power at any cost.” For this, talks for forging an alliance are also going on, she said. We will agree to alliance anywhere and in any election only when we get a respectable share of seats, otherwise the BSP will contest alone, she emphasised. Accusing the BJP of resorting to diversionary tactics ahead of the Lok Sabha polls next year, she said the saffron party was making lucrative announcements and not leaving any stone unturned to gain advantage from the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They (BJP) never followed Vajpayee's footsteps, when he was alive, she said taking a jibe. Mayawati said, “People of the country know that the campaign undertaken by the BJP and the RSS in the name of Vajpayee is an attempt to hide failures. The BJP will not benefit from this. The people of the country now understand that none of the election promises made in 2014 Lok Sabha elections was fulfilled.” Terming mob lynchings in the name of cow protection ( ) as a “blot on democracy”, Mayawati accused the BJP state governments of being lax on the issue. “The increasing tendency of indulging in mob lynching in the name of cow protection in BJP-ruled states is a blot on democracy, yet the governments are exercising laxity and are being indifferent to it,” she said. “These activities of the BJP governments (against the Dalits, tribals, backwards, Muslims and Christians) are going on from their inception and have assumed alarming proportions after they came to power,” she said, alleging the BJP after forming the government was trying to crush democratic movements. In a virtual snub to Chandrashekhar Azad, Mayawati denied reports of any association with the Bhim Army chief, days after he claimed that he and his “bua” (aunt) Mayawati have the “same blood”. “Some people in order to realise their vested political interests, some in their defence, while some to look young are trying to forge different relationships such as brother-sister and bua-bhatija (aunt and nephew) with me,” she said. Her comments came against the backdrop of the Bhim Army founder, who is also known as Ravan, reportedly claimed that, “We (he and Mayawati) both have the same blood. She may have some issues with me, I have none with her. It is not in my values to speak ill of my 'bua' (aunt). Our only aim is to defeat the BJP.” Referring to attempts made by Chandrashekhar to forge the relationship of ‘bua’ with her, Mayawati said she cannot have any “respectable relationship with these people”. Mayawati claimed the Centre was not able to come clean on the Rafale deal. Referring to demonetisation, Mayawati said, ""It was done in an unplanned manner leading to a financial emergency. It exploited the labourers, farmers, small traders and hardworking people and took the lives of over 100 persons. The BJP government should now at least tender an apology over the national tragedy."" On the possibility of misuse of SC/ST Act, Mayawati said, ""The BSP is of the view that if the current state governments follow the 'Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay' policy of her party, then there will be no misuse of this law."" The BJP on Sunday sought to know from whom BSP chief Mayawati was expecting ‘respect’ vis-a-vis her statement that her party will ally with any group as long as BSP gets “respectable share of seats”. “Is she expecting respect from those who had shattered her pride and dignity in the infamous 1995 Guest House case?,” asked media coordinator of Uttar Pradesh BJP Rakesh Tripathi. Recalling the more than two-decade-old incident, Tripathi said it was BJP MLA Brahm Dutt Dwivedi who came to Mayawati's rescue. “Today Mayawati is expecting respect from those, who had shown scant respect to her in the past. This shows how nervous she is and that her voter base has eroded,” Tripathi said. On the BSP chief's statement that BJP is not leaving any stone unturned to derive mileage from the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP media coordinator said, ""Mayawati has honoured so many great and eminent personalities by constructing their statues in Lucknow. I fail to understand why is she having any problem if the BJP is holding various programmes in honour and memory of Atalji."" Tripathi said, “Mayawati has been treating Dalits as her vote bank. The BJP on the other hand has worked to increase the bank balance of the Dalits. She is visualising that her bank is being virtually robbed. Hence she is worried.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",PTI,The Quint

"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) consolidated its position as the largest party in the Rajya Sabha with 69 seats, thus widening the gap with Congress, whose seat share has fallen to 50 seats from 54 in the recently concluded elections to the Upper House. Despite a surge in numbers, however, the 126-mark majority continues to elude the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The NDA now has 85 seats in the Rajya Sabha (not including TDP's six seats in the Upper House). Here is a party-wise representation of how the Rajya Sabha now looks like: The BJP, which earlier held 54 seats in the Rajya Sabha, has now increased its standing to 69 seats in the House. Among the 58 outgoing parliamentarians, for which the Rajya Sabha polls were held, 17 are from the BJP. On 15 March, the last day of filing nominations, 16 BJP MPs were declared elected uncontested out of a total of 33. The BJP registered a massive victory, as it won nine seats from Uttar Pradesh. The BJP members who won eight seats with ease are Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, Ashok Bajpai, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, Sakal Deep Rajbhar, Kanta Kardam, Anil Jain, Harnath Singh Yadav and GVL Narasimha Rao. The ninth candidate, businessman Anil Kumar Agarwal, was backed by the BJP, and defeated BSP's Bhimrao Ambedkar. The party's Saroj Pandey won the the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Chhattisgarh, while   emerged victorious in Jharkhand. The BJP also secured one seat in Karnataka with Rajeev Chandrasekhar's win. The Congress' numbers in the Upper House decreased to 50 seats from the earlier 54. Five Congress members were elected unopposed on 15 March, with the other five having contested in Friday's polls across five states. Among the 58 outgoing parliamentarians, 14 are from the Congress. Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, supported by the Trinamool Congress, won in West Bengal, while the CPM's Rabin Deb, backed by the Left, lost. According to election officials, Singhvi garnered 47 votes.  emerged victorious a little past midnight on Friday. However, the Congress lost to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in Telangana. Congress candidate and former union minister P Balram Naik garnered only 10 votes, as Independent member D Prakash Reddy's vote was declared invalid by the Election Commission. Two Congress members — Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and SA Sampath Kumar — could not vote as they were expelled from the House last week for allegedly hurling headphones during the governor's address, injuring Legislative Council Chairman Swamy Goud in the eye. The TMC bagged four Rajya Sabha seats in West Bengal, in taking its total seats in the House to 13 from the previous 12. Out of the 58 parliamentarians retiring soon, three are from TMC — Kunal Kumar Ghosh, Vivek Gupta and Mohammed Nadimul Haque — whose term ends on 2 April, 2018, as per the  . All four Trinamool candidates — sitting Rajya Sabha member Nadimul Haque and first-time nominees Subhasish Chakraborty, Abir Biswas and Santanu Sen — emerged victorious in the vote count. According to election officials, Trinamool's Chakraborty secured the highest number of 54 votes. Haque and Biswas got 52 votes each and Sen 51. With three party members completing their Rajya Sabha terms on 2 April, 2018, the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party won just one seat where they fielded Jaya Bachchan. This decreased its count in the Upper House to 16 seats. The Mayawati-led BSP's seat share in the House remains unchanged at five.

B Prakash, J Santosh Kumar and AB Lingaiah Yadav were elected to the Upper House. This doubles TRS' strength in the Rajya Sabha, from three to six seats. Members from parties such as BJD, TDP, RJD and JD(U) were elected unopposed on 15 March, the last day for filing of Rajya Sabha nominations. As a result, the new representation in the Upper House among these parties is as follows: BJD: 10 seats; TDP: 7 seats); RJD: 5 seats; JD(U): 9 seats; Shiv Sena: 3 seats; YSR Congress Party: 2 seats; NCP: 4 seats.

In case of direct recruitment, four percent of the total number of vacancies, up from the existing three percent, shall be reserved for people with benchmark disabilities, it said. Benchmark disability means a person with not less than forty percent of a specified disability. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) recently wrote to all central government departments to ensure that one percent of each posts be reserved for people with blindness and low vision; deaf and hard of hearing; locomotor disability including cerebral palsy, leprosy cured, dwarfism, acid attack victims, and muscular dystrophy. One percent posts each shall be also reserved for people suffering from autism, intellectual disability, specific learning disability and mental illness, it said. As per an earlier order of the DoPT, issued in 2005, three percent of the total posts were to be reserved for people with disabilities. Of these one percent each was for those with blindness or low vision; hearing impairment and locomotor disability or cerebral palsy. Under the new rules, all government organisations have been asked to appoint 'grievance redressal officers' to look into complaints. These officers will maintain a register of complaint carrying details such as date of complaint; name of complainant; the name of the establishment or person against whom the complaint has been lodged; the gist of the complaint and the date of disposal by the grievance redressal officer, the order said. Every complaint shall be inquired into within two months of its registration and outcome thereof or action taken thereon shall be communicated to the complainant or person with benchmark disability, it said. The provisions have also been made in the new rules to ensure that reservation for people with disabilities is not adjusted against the posts meant for those from Scheduled Caste and Other Backward Classes.

" The Supreme Court today slammed the Uttar Pradesh government for filing a draft report of the vision document on protection and preservation of the Taj Mahal and asked whether the apex court was supposed to vet it. A bench comprising justices M.B. Lokur and Deepak Gupta came down heavily on the Uttar Pradesh government and questioned the state’s concern in the matter. “Why have you given a draft plan? Are we supposed to vet it for you? Is it our job to vet it?” the bench asked the counsel appearing for the government. The apex court said it was “surprising” that the Archeological Survey of India (ASI), responsible for protection of the 17th century monument, was not consulted in framing the draft report. During the hearing, the bench asked Attorney General K.K. Venugopal whether the Centre or the authorities concerned had submitted the management plan on Taj Mahal to UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre in Paris. “What will happen if UNESCO says that we will withdraw the World Heritage tag of the Taj Mahal?” the bench asked Venugopal. Responding to the query, the attorney general said the Taj Mahal was one of the seven wonders of the world and it would be a “great, great embarrassment” for the country if the World Heritage tag of the historic monument was withdrawn. The apex court also asked the AG which department of the Centre and the state government was responsible for maintenance of the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ). TTZ is an area of about 10,400 sq km spread over the districts of Agra, Firozabad, Mathura, Hathras and Etah in Uttar Pradesh and Bharatpur district of Rajasthan. The top court also asked the state government to supply the draft report to a panel of conservation experts, including INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage), for their comments. The bench has listed the matter for further progress on the draft report of the vision document on August 28. In the draft vision document filed on July 24, the UP government said the entire precinct of Taj Mahal should be declared a no-plastic zone and use of bottled water be also prohibited there. The state government also said that all polluting and sick industries from the area be removed and focus should be on having a comprehensive traffic management system in which pedestrian movement should be encouraged. The draft report, running more than 220 pages, said a balanced approach towards environment and development should be adopted at Taj Mahal precinct level and the comprehensive traffic management plan should encourage the visitors to travel on foot or use eco-friendly modes of transport. It said road widening schemes in the heritage precincts to accommodate the increasing traffic need to be prohibited and battery operated eco-friendly modes of transport along tourist routes was required to be introduced with designated stops for ‘hop on hop off’. According to the state, to deal with the issue of pollution in the area, afforestation should be promoted in the TTZ region by increasing the green areas. Polluting and private vehicles should be restricted in the region. The state said no construction or built forms should be proposed on the flood plains and Yamuna river banks should only have natural plantations. It has suggested about “closure of polluting industries in the region and promotion with incentives in alterative industries as per availability of raw materials” and “removal of sick industries and allocating lands to more economical non-polluting white and green category of industries” there. The vision document was submitted after an angry apex court on July 11 had lashed out at Uttar Pradesh government for its apathy towards the historic monument. The apex court, which has been monitoring development in the area to protect the Taj Mahal built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal at Agra in 1643, would take up the matter on a day-to-day basis from July 31.",PTI,FP Staff

" Launching a scathing attack on Nitish Kumar, Tejashwi said that the Bihar chief minister's conscience was rather late in waking up this time. He said that as a Bihari, he was ashamed of the horrendous crime and the institutional efforts to save the key accused thereafter. Tejashwi said that Nitish had gotten prime accused Brijesh Thakur's name removed from the FIR. The entire gathering on the stage, led by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, lit candles in a symbolic gesture and began a march to stand in solidarity with the victims of the Muzaffarpur shelter home rapes. Tejashwi Yadav claimed that Nitish Kumar had a role to play in the delayed action against key accused Brijesh Thakur. Tejashwi alleged that the Nitish got Thakur's name removed from the FIR as he is a close aide of the chief minister. Tejashwi Yadav came down heavily on Nitish Kumar claiming that he protected the key accused Brijesh Thakur. He said that Bihar was under 'monster rule' not 'jungle rule'. He claimed that Thakur has close ties with Nitish's family. Congress president Rahul Gandhi has arrived at Jantar Mantar to join the RJD-led protest against the Bihar shelter home rape case. Rahul was seen posing with raised hands at the stage alongside other Opposition leaders, including CPM's Sitaram Yechury. Left and Trinamool Congress were also seen sharing the stage on the occasion, with Sitaram Yechury and Dinesh Trivedi present on the occasion. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal came down heavily on the Bihar government as he said that not only the wrongdoers but also the elected representatives who failed the victims should be held guilty. He said that a fast-track investigation should be launched in this case to provide prompt justice to the girls. Kejriwal said that the Nitish Kumar-led government turned a blind eye towards the plight of the 40 girls who were continuously assaulted and harassed at their shelter homes. Opposition leaders hit at out at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for not doing enough in the case. Referring to a previous episode where Nitish resigned as Railway Minister following a deadly train accident, AAP leader Sanjay Jha asked that why wasn't Nitish displaying similar righteousness this time.    Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has arrived at Jantar Mantar to participate in the protest led by RJD against Bihar rape cases. Congress president Rahul Gandhi is also expected to arrive shortly. Bihar Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav lead a dharna at Jantar Manrar in Delhi on Saturday to protest rape of 34 minor girls in a shelter home in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district. ""Against heinous institutional mass rape in Muzaffarpur... sponsored and protected by Nitish Kumar government, we will stage a dharna on Saturday,"" Tejashwi had tweeted earlier, announcing his decision to stage protest. He is expected to be joined in by several Opposition leaders to raise the heat for Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is running a coalition government with the support of BJP. Tejashwi is the younger son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad. He said Bihar Governor Satyapal Malik has written two letters to Nitish Kumar on the crime, asking him to take strict action against the culprits. ""Indirectly the Governor has questioned Chief Minister's criminal silence...I will awake Nitish Kumar's inner voice and expose his fake morality,"" Tejashwi said.

" With the ruling TRS in Telangana opting for dissolution of the state Assembly, the Telugu Desam Party is expected to take a call on electoral alliances at a crucial meeting on 8 September amid indications it was not averse to a tie-up with Congress. Amidst the fast-paced political developments in neighbouring Telangana, TDP leaders from the state rushed to Amaravati on Thursday for confabulations with party supremo and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. A resolution recommending the dissolution of the Assembly before its term ended was adopted at a meeting of the state Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao on Thursday afternoon, putting the state on election mode. The TDP is said to be not averse to forging an alliance with the Congress in Telangana as part of its state-specific policy and a decision on it would be taken by Naidu. During the the TDP's annual conclave   in May, Naidu had announced his party would emerge as the decisive force in Telangana and play the kingmakers role. Naidu will have a detailed meeting with Telangana TDP leaders in Hyderabad on the 8 September. ""We will decide on alliances after that,"" TDP general secretary E Peddi Reddy told reporters emerging from a meeting with the party supremo. He claimed the Congress was ready for an alliance with the TDP while there was also a proposal to join hands with Left parties and the Telangana Jana Samiti, floated by Professor M Kodandaram, to form a united front. ""We will discuss all this in detail and take a well thought-out decision,"" Reddy said. In the 2014 elections, the TDP in alliance with the BJP had won 15 seats in the 119-member Telangana Assembly in 2014, but 12 of the MLAs later defected to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti while another joined the Congress. Its lone MP from Telangana had also joined the TRS subsequently. The TDP has snapped its ties with the BJP this year. Interestingly, the CPM is ready to sail with Jana Sena of actor Pawan Kalyan while the CPI has not made its stand clear yet. The TDP, which suffered further jolt in Telangana when it lost the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation in 2015, was desperate to prove it was a force in the second Telugu state with a strong cadre base. It also is seeking to bank on the Andhra-Rayalaseema population settled in Telangana that could possibly influence the electoral fortunes in several constituencies across that state.",Press Trust of India,PTI
"The Supreme Court on Monday, 20 August issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government asking it to explain why Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath cannot be prosecuted for allegedly giving hate speeches in 2007,   reported. Adityanath, who was the BJP’s Gorakhpur MP in 2007, was accused of delivering provocative speeches in the city during the Muharram procession, which allegedly led to communal clashes. A bench comprising of chief justice of India Dipak Misra, and justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud sent notices to the UP government, its home department, and the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Gorakhpur. According to  , in January 2007, an altercation involving a group of Hindus and Muslims broke out during a Muharram procession in Gorakhpur leading to the hospitalisation of one Raj Kumar Agrahari.

"The Special Investigation Team probing the Gauri Lankesh murder case got a major breakthrough with a Gujarat based forensic lab confirming that Parashuram Waghmare shot and killed the activist on September 5 last year. SIT sources said the entire sequence of events was reconstructed and a video of it along with CCTV footage from the day of the incident was sent to the Directorate of Forensic Science, which confirmed that the man in both the visuals was the same. “The FSL lab confirmed that the person who appeared in both visuals was the same. It establishes our line of investigation,” said the SIT officer, requesting anonymity. Gauri Lankesh, known for her progressive and fearless writing, was shot dead at close range by unknown assailants at her home in Bangalore on September 5 2017. Meanwhile, the SIT has intensified its hunt for some more people who were either a part of the Lankesh murder case directly or indirectly. It has so far arrested 12 people. “They have absconded after the Maharashtra ATS launched a manhunt for them. They are all from Maharashtra and Goa,” the officer said. The team has also identified at least 50 people in Karnataka who were a part of this unnamed gang. They have also identified an equal number of activists in Maharashtra. “The group has a vast size and network and is active across India. We have identified many of them and have shared the names of people involved in such crimes with our higher-ups. It is up to them to take action,” he said. This fringe group, which has killed four prominent persons, Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, M.M. Kalburgi and Lankesh, showed signs of its presence after the Margao blast about nine years ago.

" The DMK on Thursday urged the Tamil Nadu government to approach the court to get the president's assent for Bills passed by the Assembly exempting the state from NEET, in case the Centre had put them in ""cold storage."" Raising the issue in the Assembly, Leader of the Opposition MK Stalin sought to know the current status of the Bills exempting the state from National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test passed last year. ""In case the centre had put the Bills in cold storage without taking action over it deliberately, a petition should be filed in the Supreme Court to get Presidential assent seeking a direction to the Centre,"" he said. In February 2017, Tamil Nadu government had adopted two Bills seeking to exempt the state from the purview of NEET and to ensure the continuation of medical admissions based on 12th standard marks. Replying, Health Minister C Vijayabaskar said ""the president has withheld the Bills,"" adding the government has sought to know the reasons from the centre. The minister said the government was ready to face the issue legally as well. Assailing the Centre for bringing in the national test by not respecting the state's rights, Stalin said it had shattered the dreams of poor and rural students to become doctors. Alleging that the test posed a big threat to social justice putting Tamil Nadu students in stress, he said there were confusions concerning NEET starting from the question paper to examination centres. It may be recalled that translation errors were reported in the NEET question paper, and several aspirants from Tamil Nadu had to go to states including Kerala to take the exam. When Stalin referred to allegations that some students belonging to other states attempted getting medical admissions in Tamil Nadu by getting nativity certificates, Vijayabaskar said rules have been tightened to avert such a situation. He said as many as 12 new provisions have been included to see to it that only students belonging to Tamil Nadu got admissions. ""Barring the All-India quota (15 percent), there is no scope for students from other states to get admissions (in Tamil Nadu quota/85 percent),"" he said. When the DMK leader said reports claimed that no financial allocation has been made for setting up AIIMS in Tamil Nadu though the location (Madurai) has been finalised, the Minister said it will be made. ""Financial sanction will be made after the (Union) Cabinet approval for the Detailed Project Report, (which is being finalised),"" he said.

" The Congress in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday raised questions about key budgetary proposals like for the proposed health insurance scheme and setting MSP at 50 percent above the cost, terming them as "" "" and also claimed the Centre was exaggerating data related to job creation. The Upper House which decided to sit till late to debate the Union budget also saw repeated adjournments post 7 pm following heated arguments between treasury benches and opposition, and protests by TDP members. However, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh managed to make his speech on the budget amidst protests by some TDP members over demands related to Andhra Pradesh. Questioning one of the key highlights of the budget, which the government has projected as a pro-farmer measure, Ramesh stated that while it has been said that the MSP would be set at 50 per cent above the cost, it had not been made clear what would be the criterion for deciding the cost of production. The cost varied according to the method chosen, he said. Referring to a newspaper interview by a NITI Aayog functionary, he said it appeared that the promise made by the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was the government's ""jumla number one"". He also claimed that insufficient funds were allocated for the health insurance scheme. Ramesh claimed the scheme would anyway benefit private hospitals rather than the public. It is being touted as 'ModiCare', he said. Taking a jibe, he said by this logic AIIMS may be called an institute of ""Modical"" sciences. Ramesh said that an insurance scheme existed during the UPA tenure and only the money had been increased. It was a work in continuation, he claimed. A former Union minister, Ramesh, said that a health assurance approach would have been better than an insurance scheme as past experience has demonstrated. He said the budgetary allocation required for the scheme was somewhere between 12,000 crore to 1 lakh crore but a grossly insufficient Rs 2,000 crore had been allocated. He termed the scheme as ""NAMO, or no allocation, messaging only"". On jobs front, Ramesh said the government was focussing on the EPFO figures to estimate jobs created, which he claimed was a wrong approach. He said the raise in provident fund accounts had happened as there was formalisation of the informal sector due to GST and demonetisation. Even as this was a beneficial result of these two measures, he said exaggerated claims related to job creation were being made based on EPFO data, he said. ""To say all these jobs are new, would be completely wrong,"" Ramesh said seeking to punch holes in the government's claims on employment. He said recent comments by the chief economic advisor had also indicated the same. Referring to BJP member Subramanian Swamy, he said the senior leader had recently stated there was pressure on the central statistical organisation to present data in such a way that it appears there was no unfavourable impact of GST and demonetisation. He also questioned the government's claims on ease of doing business and said the rise in India's rankings was only courtesy a change criterion used for measuring the performance of various countries. The government was, however, presenting it as some sort of miracle, he said. He said that thought India had moved upwards, it was only due to the new insolvency law that was brought in. These measures, however, encourage a hire and fire policy towards employees, he said. Ramesh accused the government of making exaggerated claims on issues like job creation. Following Ramesh's speech, BJP member Mahesh Poddar and SP leader Neeraj Shekhar also spoke. The discussion will continue on Friday. Earlier, after Rajeev Chandrashekhar (Independent) had spoken, the Chair called Ramesh to move the debate on the Budget further. Ramesh said the Budget was ""unusual and historic"" because soon after its presentation, the Prime Minister came on deferred live telecast to decode the Budget. Normally, he said that after Budget, the prime minister congratulates his finance minister for its presentation. Before he could continue, members from the treasury benches objected to the comments. This lead to heated arguments between BJP and Congress. Some other opposition members too supported the Congress. The Chair tried to pacify the two sides, but in vain. The House was adjourned for 10 minutes. When the House reassembled, Ramesh continued his speech. In the meanwhile, CM Ramesh of TDP and three of his party colleagues entered the Well carrying placards. They were also shouting slogans. The Chair asked them to return to seats but in vain. Deputy Chairman Bhubaneswar Kalita asked Ramesh to continue his speech even as TDP members were raising slogans. Ramesh said he could not speak amid the din and got support from other opposition members also. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel urged the protesting members to return to seats. However, they did not yield. The Chair adjourned the House for another 10 minutes. When the House met again, there was ruckus and another adjournment followed. When the House met again, the protesting TDP members again came to the Well. Opposition members asked the Chair to bring the House in order. But as the stalemate continued, the Chair adjourned the Rajya Sabha for 30 minutes for dinner. It was at the next assembling of the House that Ramesh managed to complete his speech.",PTI,FP Staff
" Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday said the Congress president's failed politics is compelling him to resort to 'falsehood' and 'petty hair-splitting' to make the sensitive Rafale purchase defence deal controversial. Jaitley also said that it was the Congress-led UPA which delayed the purchase of the Rafale aircraft which was necessary to improve the combat ability of Indian Air Force. He was responding to allegations made by Gandhi that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has admitted to ""theft"" in the Rafale deal before the Supreme Court and to changes in the contract without asking the Air Force. In a series of tweets, Jaitley said that 'falsehood' cannot be a substitute for ""failed politics"" of Gandhi.

" As campaigning for upcoming bypolls to Kolaras and Mungaoli assembly segments has started getting intense, erstwhile royals — Yashodhara Raje Scindia of the BJP and her nephew Jyotiraditya Scindia of the Congress — are trying to strike the emotional chord with electorates. The outcome of the 24 February bypolls for the two seats, currently represented by the Congress, will be perceived as a pointer to the public mood ahead of the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections slated later this year. While state Sports and Youth Welfare Minister Yashodhara Raje is seeking votes in Kolaras constituency by invoking the legacy of her mother late Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, a formidable BJP doyen, Jyotiraditya is referring to his late father Madhavrao Scindia's contribution in the development of the area. Kolaras and Mungaoli assembly segments are parts of Jyotiraditya's Guna Lok Sabha constituency. Yashodhara Raje hit the hustings with the promise of development and is appealing to people to vote for her loyalist Devendra Jain. ""If you vote for Jain, you will get 1+1 MLA (one for free),"" she said during campaigning. Jain had won Kolaras in 2008. However, Congress' Ram Singh Yadav snatched the seat from the BJP in 2013 polls. Against this backdrop, Yashodhara Raje is trying hard to win back the seat for the saffron party. Sanjay Sharma, a social worker based in Shivpuri-Gwalior who had witnessed elections in the area for the last four decades, said, ""Normally, Scindia family members never campaign against each other and avoid face-to-face contest despite being in different parties"". However, a perception is growing that Yashodhara Raje and Jyotiraditya are campaigning against each other, in a departure from convention. ""This was the tradition we have seen from the days of Rajmata Scindia. If Madhavrao contested from Gwalior, then his mother used to fight elections from Guna. They never contested against each other and also avoided campaigning against any member of the family despite having different political parties affiliations,"" Sharma said. However, this time it appears and even people feel that they are campaigning against each other in the name of their respective parties, he said. According to Sharma, Jyotiraditya is reminding people of their old association with his father, while Yashodhara Raje is highlighting her mother's deep connection with the common man and her contribution to his welfare. However, Jyotiraditya's close aide and Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi denied that it was a Scindia versus Scindia contest. ""In fact, it is a contest between Jyotiraditya and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, as almost all senior ministers of his cabinet, including Yashodhara Raje, are campaigning in the bypoll whereas he (Jyotiraditya) is electioneering alone with the support of senior party leaders,"" he said. Chaturvedi admitted that Jyotiraditya mentioned about his father's developmental works in the area, including establishing railway network and his long association with the people, while campaigning. ""Yashodhara Raje is a minister in Chouhan's cabinet and she is representing the chief minister in the area. So it is a contest between Jyotiradtya and Shivraj,"" he said. Chaturvedi said the fact that the chief minister and 17 ministers are campaigning in Kolaras and Mungaoli betrays ""frustration"" of the ruling party. ""Besides Chouhan, 17 other ministers are campaigning in the two constituencies and that shows the level of frustration among the BJP leaders as they have not done anything for the development of the state despite being in power for three terms,"" Chaturvedi said. According to state BJP chief spokesperson Deepak Vijaywargiya, the main battle is between the saffron party and the Congress. ""In order to show his importance in the Congress, Jyotiraditya is projecting himself as an option to the state chief minister. However, Scindia stands nowhere in comparison to Chouhan who is a popular CM for close to three terms,"" he added.

""High command will decide on Badami,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters at Mysuru, where he is camping since Monday for campaigning in Chamundeshwari and Varuna, constituencies from where he and his son Yathindra respectively are the candidates. Asked if he would contest from two constituencies, opting for Badami too, he said ""(I'll do) whatever high command decides...""

Siddaramaiah has said he was still under pressure to contest from Badami, fuelling speculation again whether he would opt for an alternative or a second constituency. Not acceding to Siddaramaiah's reported wish to contest from two seats, Chamundeshwari and Badami, the Congress in its list of candidates for 218 seats announced on 15 April, had named Devraj Patil as its nominee from Badami. But issuing of B-form (required to be filed by a political party mentioning name of its approved candidate) to Patil has been put on hold.

The highly speculated move had come hours after Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in New Delhi told the media that granting of special status to Andhra Pradesh was not possible after the 14th Finance Commission recommendations.

In the recently held Lok Sabha by-elections, the BJP has lost most of the seats and was ""defeated"" in the Karnataka assembly polls. ""I can tell you that the BJP is going to lose the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. There will be a one-to-one fight everywhere,"" he said. Roy accused prime minister Narendra Modi of lowering public discourse through his public speeches on various issues and claimed that the announcements made on farmer welfare programmes were nothing but ""eye-wash"".

" Recent temple visits by Congress president Rahul Gandhi do not indicate any change in the party's strategy as his father and grandmother too had offered prayers in shrines, Karnataka state unit chief G Parameshwara said on Wednesday. ""Indira  (Indira Gandhi) and Rajiv  (Rajiv Gandhi) used to visit Sringeri swami.. Indira  also visited many temples in Karnataka... There is no change in our and Rahul 's strategy,"" the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President told  . He was replying to a question whether Rahul Gandhi's visits to temples during the Gujarat Assembly polls, his assertion that he and his family members were Shiv   (devotees of Lord Shiva) and reports that he planned to meet religious heads in Karnataka indicated any perceptible change in the party's poll strategy. Asked if Gandhi will be visiting temples during his coming tour of Karnataka, the KPCC chief said, ""He may visit if someone suggests, but he has not planned as such."" The BJP had termed Rahul Gandhi's frequent visits to temples during Gujarat election campaign as an attempt to attract Hindu votes. He had kicked started his tour of north Gujarat after offering prayers at Akshardham and Ambaji temples. Hitting back at the BJP, Parameshwara said the saffron party anyway, did not hold ""patent on devotion"". The perceptible change in Congress strategy was to work towards Rajiv Gandhi's dream of building a modern India, he said. Parameshwara also denied media reports that Rahul Gandhi had cautioned Karnataka Congress leaders against raising 'beef' and 'Hindutva terror' issues during the coming poll campaign. ""We never discussed issues relating to beef and Hindutva terror during the meeting with Rahul , and neither has he cautioned us against raising it... We only discussed strategies, selection criteria and campaign,"" he said. Claiming that it was BJP's trap to divert Congress from real issues, the senior Congress leader said the ruling party would focus on development issues and its performance during the last five years. ""If BJP talks about Hindutva, we will talk about development.. Our agenda is an inclusive agenda... Their agenda is to divide people on the basis of Hindutva or religion,"" he alleged.",PTI,PTI
" Anubhav Mishra  Ashutosh Bhardwaj The monsoon session of Parliament was productive for the government with 20 bills passed by Lok Sabha and 14 by the Rajya Sabha even as the Opposition and the treasury benches clashed on a range of issues such as NRC and the Rafale fighter jet deal. The government, however, could not get the Triple Talaq Bill passed in the Rajya Sabha even though the cabinet on Thursday, 9 August, approved some amendments to the Bill passed by the Lok Sabha. But it gave a significant push to its legislative agenda by getting several pending bills passed and introducing a few others. The monsoon session began on 18 July and had 17 sittings. The session, which was a stark contrast with the nearly washed-out second part of Budget session, saw the first no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government. The no-confidence motion was not taken up during the Budget session amid protests by members from Andhra Pradesh for a special package for the state. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) scored an emphatic victory over a combined opposition in the election to the Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman even though it is short of a majority in the Upper House. The Lok Sabha worked 110 per cent of its scheduled time and passed 20 bills. Congress President Rahul Gandhi led the party's attack on the government on the Rafale deal as he sought answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The party repeatedly raised the issue in both Houses seeking a joint parliamentary committee inquiry. The issue of National Register of Citizens in Assam, which has left out over 40 lakh people, figured in both Houses with the Opposition accusing the government of its tardy implementation. Trinamool Congress was at the forefront of the NRC protest and virtually prevented BJP president Amit Shah from speaking in the Upper House on issues concerning farmers. While the Lok Sabha lost 8 hours and 26 minutes due to disruptions, the members sat for 20 hours and 43 minutes beyond the scheduled time. The Rajya Sabha lost 27 hours and 42 minutes and sat beyond scheduled time on four days gaining about three hours. Several significant legislations were passed during the session, including that on granting constitutional status to National Commission of Backward Classes and on restoring the immediate arrest provision in the SC/ST Act. Yet another Bill paved the way to enable the overseas electors to appoint proxies to cast their votes in the elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies. Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said the session ""brought new tidings marking a break from the last two sessions."" Parliament is expected to now meet for the winter session, which may be the last full session of Parliament before the general elections due next year. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" Senior Congress leader P Chidamabaram on Friday predicted a broad alliance of non-BJP parties in at least 25 states in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls that will bring a coalition government, while his colleague Kapil Sibal said there is no way the BJP can retain power if Opposition parties unite. Speaking at a discussion after the launch of Sibal's book ""Shades of Truth"", Opposition leaders exuded confidence that a non-BJP government would be in place in 2019 while calling for the need of a coalition of like-minded parties. Among those present at the launch were former prime minister Manmohan Singh, former vice-president M Hamid Ansari and a host of Opposition leaders. Leaders from the Samajwadi Party, the DMK and the Bahujan Samaj Party were not there. ""I never predict the future. I will predict a step ahead of the election results. I think there is a very very good chance that there will be a broad coalition of non-BJP parties in at least 25 states. That I will predict today. If that happens, then I think night falls day, or day falls night, the result is foretold,"" Chidambaram said when asked about what will happen in 2019. Sibal, however, said, ""I think everything will depend on two key states — Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. And if Gorakhpur, Kairana and Phulpur are any indication, when the Opposition unites, then the BJP cannot win. If we can replicate that in Bihar and in Uttar Pradesh, I think there is no chance for the BJP."" Former JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav said, ""It is impossible to get everyone together, but even if there is possible unity, this government will have to go."" He said all sections of society are being suppressed and the entire country will defeat the BJP in 2019 and the country's Constitution and its values will be restored after that. CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, while refusing to predict election result, said ""What we will work for is to make sure that this government does not return to power, and we will work to strengthen India through a coalition of all the progressive secular forces."" Trinamool Congress leader Chandan Mitra, formerly a BJP MP, however, struck a discordant note saying while the Opposition is expected to win, there will be a regional leader leading it, as the rules will be changed now. Yechury said, ""The Trinamool Congress will correct the historical blunder committed by the CPM."" Former prime minister Singh, however, refused to make any prediction for the next Lok Sabha polls. Sibal noted,""I think it is time to understand that India as a nation is a coalition. Only coalitions with compromises can take this country forward. Since 2014, the nature of our polity has changed and the difference between the party and the government has ended. It is the party that runs the government and not the government that runs the country,"" Sibal said. Chidambaram, however, said since 1989, the Lok Sabha elections have been a collection of state elections as no longer one leader will sway the elections in the country. ""2019 will not be different and it will be a state-specific election. In every state a non-BJP coalition will be formed defeat the BJP. It is wrong to assume that India's election will be a presidential election,"" he said. Asked if Rahul Gandhi was up to the job of taking on prime minister Modi, Sibal said, ""The prime minister sold dreams to India in 2014. Has he been up to his job?"" For the first time, Chidambaram also acknowledged publicly that the party was divided and he was against impeachment of Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, a move that finally failed, while Yechury said the move was delayed and much time was lost in bringing about consensus.",Press Trust of India,Press Trust of India
"Union Minister Uma Bharti on Sunday, 4 November, said while Hindus were the ""most tolerant"" people in the world, any talk of constructing a mosque on the periphery of a Ram temple in Ayodhya could make them ""intolerant"". ""Hindus are the most tolerant community in the world. I will appeal to all politicians: please don't make Hindus intolerant by talking about building a mosque on the outer periphery of the birthplace of Lord Ram in Ayodhya,"" Bharti told PTI. She said when there could not be a temple in the holy town of Medina or a mosque in the Vatican City, it would be ""unfair"" to talk about a mosque in Ayodhya. Describing the Ayodhya dispute as one of land and not faith, the firebrand Hindu leader said, ""This is now only a matter of dispute of land, not dispute of faith. It has been resolved that Ayodhya is the birth place of Lord Ram."" She also stressed the need for an out-of-court settlement of the contentious issue, and urged all political leaders – including Gandhi, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, BSP leader Mayawati and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee – to support this. ""We need support of all political parties on this issue. I invite all leaders including, Rahul Gandhiji, come let's lay the foundation stone of the Ram temple with me,"" Bharti said. By doing so, the Gandhi-scion could atone for the past sins of the Congress, which always created ""hurdles"" in building the temple in Ayodhya, she said. SP supremo Mulayam Singh, Banerjee, Mayawati and the Left parties should support the BJP on this issue as it is of national interest, she said. ""But they aren't letting the matter get resolved. The Congress will have to quit the habit of dividing the country in the name of religion,"" Bharti said, reiterating that all political parties should unite on this issue. Bharti, who had participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the 1990s, said she was fully committed to the construction of Ram temple. ""If they tell me that Ram Mandir will be built only over my dead body, then so be it,"" she said.

"Turning the heat on the Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government, Tejashwi Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) made some serious allegations against the Bihar chief minister at a sit-in protest he had called in New Delhi's Jantar Mantar on Saturday. The meet was organised to protest against the  , where around 40 inmates of the centre were allegedly sexually abused and harassed repeatedly over a period of two years. Alleging that  (Nitish Kumar) had turned Bihar into a  (monster rule), Tejashwi said the Bihar chief minister was protecting the key accused in the case. He accused Nitish of having Brijesh Thakur's name removed from the FIR filed in the case as the latter shared a good personal rapport with him. The RJD leader also claimed that the chief minister had   despite repeated red flags because Thakur — the prime accused in the case and a local strongman — had strong ties with the ruling Janata Dal (United) (JDU). The  , which was attended by several prominent political faces including Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, saw a huge turnout of Delhi residents, Opposition members and social activists. Rahul and Kejriwal also spoke at the event, each expressing shock at the horrendous details of the crime. They also called for a speedy investigation and trial in the case, while fixing responsibility with  . Tejashwi used the opportunity to mount a scathing attack on Nitish, claiming that his government had failed to prevent a grievous crime intentionally as it wanted to shield the accused. Tejashwi said that for months, the Bihar government ignored reports submitted by various NGOs that flagged suspicious activities at the Muzaffarpur shelter home. Accusing Nitish of having the name of the key accused removed from FIRs, the RJD leader also questioned the chief minister's prolonged silence on the matter. Nitish had reacted to the incident on Friday, saying that he was ashamed of the crime, and that the guilty will not be spared. However, the matter came to light nearly two months ago,   by Tata Institute of Social Sciences uncovered that the inmates, including minor girls, were sedated and sexually assaulted frequently. Tejashwi's party, the Congress and the Hindustani Awam Morcha — a splinter group of the JD(U) — had taken up the matter in the Bihar Assembly several times. At the protest in Delhi on Saturday, Tejashwi said it was after repeated attacks from the Opposition and constant media glare that Nitish finally reacted. ""I told you I will force you to break your silence, and I did),"" he said. Tejashwi also made a jibe against Nitish, who had cut ties with the RJD last year, claiming that the alliance weighed heavily on his conscience. On Saturday, Tejashwi said that the Bihar chief minister's conscience was rather late in waking up this time. ""We have come to Delhi because my   (Nitish Kumar) soul has not woken up yet to these crimes. He says there is a rule of law in  It is not 'jungle  ', but ‘ ,"" he said. He also claimed that one of the older victims, who was capable of giving a detailed account of the crimes at the Muzaffarpur shelter home, has been sent to another shelter home, and there has been no information on her whereabouts since then. ""Since the identity of the girls is protected, who knows, the victims may be swapped to protect the victims,"" he alleged. The event turned into a platform to showcase Opposition unity as several leaders from non-NDA parties, who have yet to take a call on alliance partners in future polls, were present at the Jantar Mantar event. RJD leaders and workers, along with several other Opposition leaders, gathered at the Delhi protest site in huge numbers. Apart from Rahul and Kejriwal, those present included Samajwadi Party leader Ghanshyam Tiwari, Tejashwi's sister Misa Bharati, JD(U)'s rebel leader and former party supremo Sharad Yadav, AAP's Somnath Bharti and Sanjay Jha, Trinamool Congress leaders Dinesh Trivedi and the Communist Party of India's D Raja. The Opposition leaders tried to drive home the message that the protest was the civil society's reaction to the ""shameful incident"" and not a political movement. Speaking to reporters from the venue, RJD MP Manoj Jha said they had made the conscious decision not to use any political party's flag to ensure that the issue is not politicised. The party leaders were also seen requesting the crowd to not raise slogans against any particular person or party. However, when Rahul took the stage, he used the occasion to refer to the Opposition unity and claimed that the BJP-RSS ideology was sidelined. ""The RSS is one side and the entire Opposition is on the other side. India will not tolerate this kind of attack on hits culture, history and institutions,"" he said. ""You see how the Opposition stands united here. India stands united while the BJP and RSS stand on the other side. It will be more visible very soon. India is saying that whatever happened in the past four years was not good... There were attacks on Indian culture. But when Indians make up their mind, no one stands a chance against them."" Tejashwi made a strong pledge for Nitish to quit, saying that while he had been prompt in the past to show off his righteousness, this crime had truly left him no right to remain in his post. RJD's Manoj Jha said his party demanded three things through the protests — Nitish's resignation as the chief minister of Bihar, a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation and a prompt trial and justice. ""Enough is enough Nitish ji.. you don't have any moral right to remain in your post. Quit and quit now,"" Manoj Jha said. Kejriwal, too, weighed in and resonated similar sentiments, but he did not explicitly seek a resignation. He pointed out that it was the case of the Delhi gangrape in December 2012 and the protests that followed that put the UPA government out of power. ""Here, 40 small girls were harassed for years. We should be ashamed of ourselves, and the responsibility should be fixed with those whose oversight led to the crime staying undetected,"" he added. AAP's Sanjay Jha also said Nitish should quit from his post on moral grounds. Referring to a previous episode where Nitish had resigned as the Union railway minister after a deadly train accident in 1999, he also asked that why the JD(U) chief was not displaying similar righteousness this time. Kejriwal also demanded that the guilty in the case be hanged till death within three months. ""I demand that the investigation and trial be completed within three months and those found guilty be hanged to death,"" the Delhi chief minister said. Rahul, meanwhile, latched on to Nitish's recent reaction and said: ""Nitish Kumar said he is ashamed of what happened in Muzaffarpur. If you are truly ashamed, then you should act now against the culprits and ensure speedy justice for the girls.""",FP Staff,FP Staff

": The 18 February Assembly polls were important not only for Tripura, but entire India, as it would show which way the country would move, CPM politburo member Prakash Karat said in Belonia on Friday.

He asserted that the Left Front government in Tripura was the most clean and pro-people and that it always tried to protect the harmony between the tribals and non-tribals.

"With only four of the 5,407 Bru families returning to Mizoram since the final repatriation process began on August 25, the state government termed it a “futile exercise” and withdrew the officials sent to neighbouring Tripura to oversee the exercise. The officials who were deployed in the six Bru relief camps of north Tripura district have already returned, Mizoram additional secretary for home Lalbiakzama said Monday. The repatriation process was scheduled to continue for a month till September 25. “The state government is regarding it a futile exercise in view of the mood at the relief camps. We had to withdraw the officials as no Bru family returned since Tuesday (August 28),” Lalbiakzama said. Between August 25 and 27, only four refugee families returned from the relief camps in Tripura. Thereafter, no Bru refugee showed any interest in heading back, he said. In a November 2016 survey, 32,876 Brus belonging to 5,407 families were identified as bona fide residents of Mizoram, who could be repatriated. However, in a recent study, just 2,753 people belonging to 423 families expressed their willingness to return. The Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum (MBDPF), an organisation that has been fighting for the rights of the community, signed an agreement with the Centre and Mizoram and Tripura governments in July to accept a repatriation package. The agreement stipulated that Rs 4 lakh for each repatriated Bru family would be deposited in the bank account of the head of the family and Rs 1.5 lakh doled out as housing assistance. Each repatriated Bru family would also be given Rs 5,000 through Direct Benefit Transfer every month and free ration for two years. Senior officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs had said the relief camps would be closed down by the first week of October and assistance allotted for the inmates to be discontinued forthwith. A section of the refugees, however, were not happy with the package offered to them and demanded more. Mizo Bru Displaced People’s Coordination Committee (MBDPCC), another organisation of the refugees in Tripura, sought central security after their repatriation. “The Brus fled Mizoram during ethnic clashes since 1997. We will now feel insecure on our return. We want central security, cluster villages and Area Development Council if we have to return,” MBDPCC president Laldinliana maintained. Thousands of Bru refugees from Mizoram fled to Tripura during an ethnic violence in 1997. The clashes broke out after a forest official was killed by Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF) militants. The Centre, in association with the governments of Mizoram and Tripura, was repatriating the displaced Brus in phases. Though several Bru families have returned to Mizoram over the years, many refused to leave Tripura citing security reasons and inadequate package.",PTI,PTI
" Former Union minister Prithviraj Chavan attacked the Central government on Sunday on a number of issues including ""lack of jobs"" for the youth. He alleged the government was pursuing the Bullet train and the Samruddhi Corridor projects which are of no use for the common man. The bullet train project envisages connecting Mumbai in Maharashtra to Ahmedabad in Gujarat through the high-speed train. The proposed Sammrudhi Corridor project aims at constructing a mega-highway connecting Mumbai to Nagpur, a distance of over 700 kilometres.

" The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed a magistrate in Uttar Pradesh to pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law in a rioting case allegedly involving chief minister Adityanath. A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud disposed of a petition challenging the Allahabad high court order dismissing a plea filed by one Rasheed Khan in the case. “We only direct the magistrate (in Gorakhpur), as the high court has remitted the matter to him, to pass appropriate orders keeping in view the law laid down. The Special Leave Petition stands disposed of accordingly,” the bench said. The case, according to the police, pertains to a 2007 incident in the Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh when Adityanath was an MP. The FIR said that on January 27, 2007, on the occasion of Satvi Moharram, a call was given by Adityanath, following which members of right-wing outfit Hindu Vahini, traders and businessman started assembling and raising slogans. It said that at about 10 am that day, the agitators set several properties ablaze, damaged religious books and indulged in destructive activities at the Imam Chowk in Gorakhpur.

" In an unusual attack on his party's ally Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party, Uttar Pradesh BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey said Saturday its chief Om Prakash Rajbhar was a ""necessary evil"" and comments made by him ""should not be taken seriously"". Rajbhar, a state minister, has often been critical of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and policies of its governments at the Centre and in the state. ""The region where Om Prakash Rajbhar's party is having presence, we are having good relationship with its supporters, workers and office-bearers. But, ' ' (attitude) of Rajbhar is not appropriate,"" Pandey told   in an interview. The BJP leader referred to an eastern UP folklore to target the SBSP leader. In the folklore, a woman used to head towards her paternal home after frequent tiff with her husband, while her in-laws and others used to placate her. Later, the village decided that no one will try to placate her. After she moved out of the village, she caught hold of a goat and started crying that even it was not stopping her from leaving her in-laws' place. ""Similar is his (Rajbhar's) situation,"" Pandey said. The UP BJP chief said there is a ""limit"" to getting angry virtually every day and reproach. ""Hence, I say that his statements should not be taken seriously,"" Pandey said. Asked whether the BJP will try to persuade the disgruntled ally, Pandey said, ""We are running a government in the state with overwhelming majority. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are doing exemplary work. On such a large ' ', in political arena, there are some necessary evils (   ) who accompany you. As of now, it is Om Prakash (Rajbhar) who is a necessary evil and accompanying (us)."" The BJP leader claimed that the entire Rajbhar community was with the saffron party. In the 2017 UP assembly elections, the SBSP contested eight seats and won four of them. Rajbhar became a cabinet minister holding the portfolio of backward class welfare and divyangjan empowerment. Attacking the UP government for renaming Faizabad and Allahabad, Rajbhar had said it negated India's ""Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb"" (composite culture). The SBSP leader said that instead of changing names of cities, districts and railway stations, the BJP should start with changing names of its prominent Muslim leaders. ""The BJP changed names of Mughalsarai and Faizabad. They say these were named after the Mughals. They have national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Uttar Pradesh minister Mohsin Raza —three Muslim faces of the BJP.

"The Supreme Court on Monday, 7 May, struck down the amendment to an Uttar Pradesh legislation which allows former chief ministers of the state to retain government accommodation even after resigning from office. A bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi said the amendment in the legislation was ultra vires to the Constitution since it transgresses the concept of equality under the Constitution. The bench said the amendment was ""arbitrary, discriminatory"" and violates the concept of equality. The apex court said that once such persons demit public office, there is nothing to distinguish them from the average citizen. The apex court had, on 19 April 2018, reserved its verdict on an NGO's plea challenging amendments to the UP legislation allowing ex-chief ministers of the state to continue occupying government bungalows. The top court had earlier observed that if the provision, which has been challenged by NGO Lok Prahari, was held invalid, then similar legislation in other states might also come under challenge. The NGO had challenged the amendments made by the erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government to the 'UP Ministers (Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1981'.

" The alliance between Ajit Jogi's party and the BSP will hurt the BJP, which is under the ""illusion"" that the tie-up will hamper the Congress's prospects in the upcoming  , state Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel said Sunday. Baghel, who is seen as one of the contenders for the chief minister's post, along with other senior party leaders like TS Singhdeo and Charandas Mahant if the Congress comes to power in the BJP-ruled state, asserted that currently, there were no claimants for the top post and the matter would be decided only after the polls. ""There are no claimants (for the chief minister's post), and we will fight the election under a collective leadership. It is only after the polls that the Legislative Party and the party high-command will decide who will be the chief minister. This is not a contentious matter,"" he told   in a telephonic interview from Raipur. The Congress is seeking to oust the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been governing the state since 2003, from power this time. When asked whether the alliance between the Ajit Jogi-led Janta Congress Chhattisgarh and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will cut into the Congress's vote share, Baghel said, ""No, because the BSP has just about 4 percent of the vote share and Jogi's vote base is also the same as that of the BSP. So I do not think it (the alliance) will make a big difference."" He claimed that the Jogi-BSP tie-up will harm the BJP, the Congress. Elaborating on his point, the state Congress chief said of the seats reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) category, the Congress had won just one in the 2013 Assembly polls, while the BJP had emerged victorious in nine. ""Their (Jogi-Mayawati's) support base comprises mostly members of the SC community. So, even if they get a few seats, which looks unlikely, it is the BJP's tally that will come down,"" Baghel added. On BJP leader Saroj Pandey's remarks that the Jogi-BSP alliance will hurt the Congress more in Chhattisgarh, he said the saffron camp was under the ""illusion"" that the tie-up will affect the opposition party. ""That is why they (the BJP) got the alliance done. Alone, Jogi was unable to harm the Congress, so the BSP was also tagged along with him. The Jogi factor will not work,"" Baghel added. On why the Congress failed to stitch-up alliances in the state, he said, ""As far as the BSP is concerned, talks were on and suddenly, we got to know that they had aligned with Jogi's party."" Baghel added that talks with the Gondwana Gantantra Party failed as the Congress offered two seats to the tribal outfit, but with a one-per cent vote share, it was asking for five-six seats. Asked if not projecting a chief ministerial face could hamper the party's chances in the upcoming polls, he pointed out that the BJP had fought the 2003 state election without projecting a chief ministerial candidate and the name of Raman Singh was announced for the top post only after the polls. There were very few instances when the Congress had announced a chief ministerial face beforehand, Baghel said. On whether the issue of chief ministership would breed ambition and factionalism within the party ranks, he said, ""These days, even seers have ambitions of becoming chief minister. We are not even seers, we are in politics. So, we aspire for a political position, but we are not so ambitious that we will cross the party's boundaries. All the leaders are working unitedly."" Asked about the BJP's ""Mission 65"", Baghel said the Congress was focussed on all the 90 Assembly seats in the state and it was confident of securing a clear majority. Taking a jibe at the BJP, he said in Gujarat also the saffron party had set a ""Mission 150"" target, but ended up with 99 seats. The state Congress chief has been embroiled in a controversy over his alleged involvement in a fake sex CD case. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had last month filed a chargesheet, naming Baghel and some others as accused in the case related to a controversial CD allegedly featuring a state minister, who had rejected it as fake. The BJP has used the issue to target the Congress, while Baghel has claimed innocence and described it as a political attack. Asked about the case, the Congress leader dismissed it as a ""conspiracy"" of the BJP. The Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases. In the first phase, 18 seats in the Naxalism-hit areas will go to the polls on 12 November. The second phase of polling for the remaining 72 seats will be held on 20 November and the results will be announced on 11 December. Baghel will contest the polls from Patan. In 2013, the BJP had formed the government in Chhattisgarh for the third consecutive time by winning 49 seats against the 39 of the Congress, but the opposition party had succeeded in narrowing the gap in terms of vote share.

""We have met more than 500 intellectuals in the last few months but not many of them have come forward to join us. During the last two intellectuals' meet, we have not been able to rope anyone prominent. We hope things are different this time,"" another BJP leader on the condition of anonymity had told  . Ghosh along with a senior BJP central leader had approached Samir Aich, an eminent painter, and requested him to attend the meet. ""But he was not interested in attending the meet,"" he said. Aich along with other intellectuals had stood by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee during her anti-land acquisition struggle, but later became a critic of the TMC government and its policies.",FP Staff,FP Staff
"The process of filing petitions for H-1B, considered the most sought-after work visa among highly skilled Indian professionals, begins today (2 April) amidst unprecedented scrutiny by the Trump administration. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the federal agency responsible for processing all H-1B visas, has indicated there will be zero tolerance by it for even minor errors. Chatter at various social media platforms and groups indicate that immigration attorneys this time expect a much high rate of rejection. The H1-B visas have an annual numerical limit cap of 65,000 each fiscal year, as mandated by the Congress. The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries with a US master's degree or higher are exempt from the cap. Days ahead of the start of the H-1B visa application process for the fiscal year 2019, beginning 1 October this year; USCIS warned that all duplicate applications would be subject to rejection. In previous years, filing of duplicate petitions by companies had become a normal practice so that applicants could have greater chance in getting through the lottery. USCIS has also said that it will reject H-1B petitions requesting an earlier employment start date or a start date of ""As Soon As Possible"" or ""ASAP."" Expecting a huge rush of application beginning 3 April, and greater scrutiny of all petitions which would require much more man hours, USCIS has also temporarily suspended premium processing. ""We will announce the start date for premium processing in the near future,"" the federal agency said. ""Complete all sections of the form accurately… The petitioner should include a copy of the beneficiary's valid passport,"" USCIS said. If the applicant is seeking an extension of stay or change of status, he/she should include evidence to establish that the beneficiary will maintain a valid non-immigrant status through the employment start date being requested, USCIS said in its filing tips. As in the previous years, Indian companies would have to pay a higher fee per application than those from other countries. On an average they are required to pay $6,000 to the federal government per H-1B application. And by the time the successful applicant appears before the American diplomatic missions – embassies and consulates – for a formal visa interview and stamping on their passport, they would have to be ready with details such as social media profiles, emails and phone numbers in the last five years. On Friday, the State Department issued a formal notification in this regard which would come into force after 90 days. Ahead of the H-1B visa filing process, USCIS said this work visa should help US companies recruit highly-skilled foreign nationals when there is a shortage of qualified workers in the country. ""Yet, too many American workers who are as qualified, willing, and deserving to work in these fields have been ignored or unfairly disadvantaged. Employers who abuse the H-1B visa program may negatively affect US workers, decreasing wages and opportunities as they import more foreign workers,"" it said. ""These efforts will help assist in the prosecution of program violators and ensure that American workers are not overlooked or replaced in the process,"" USCIS said.

" A contentious bill to ban cow slaughter and ensure stabilisation of the population of the Indian breed of bovines was on Friday withdrawn by BJP member Subramanian Swamy in the Rajya Sabha, after the government urged him to do so. While withdrawing his Cow Protection Bill 2017 during the private members' business, Swamy said he would like the government to put a voluntary cess to ensure that the cows are looked after they cease to give milk. During a 2-hour discussion on the bill, the Upper House witnessed heated exchanges when members of the Opposition objected to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal standing up and saying that such an important issue was being ""made fun of"", after Samajwadi Party member Javed Ali Khan spoke on it. Khan said cow should be immediately declared the national animal and provisions made whereby the government is held responsible for rearing and nourishment of cows. He also said India must end its diplomatic ties with countries which trade in meat. Intervening in the debate, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said over the past 3.5 years, the government has been working on various schemes related to cow welfare. ""We have been taking steps for the protection and promotion of the cow. I want to assure Swamy that we are working in the same direction. With these words I request you to withdraw the bill,"" the Minister said. In response, Swamy said ""I wanted a law to come, but want the government to seriously consider putting a voluntary cess for the purpose of ensuring that cows are looked after they cease to give milk."" He said 'gaushalas' (cow sheds) should be set up and scientifically run. An authority to ensure stabilization of population of cows ( ) should also be set up and the people would not hesitate to contribute. ""So the only thing that remains is the law. But since the minister has said that in consulation with me, he will proceed in this matter. I would like to give government one more chance so that I don't have to come back again with another bill. ... Therefore, permit me to withdraw the bill,"" Swamy told the Chair. During the debate, Congress member Rajeev Shukla asked Swamy, ""Why doesn't the BJP discuss the matter of cow slaughter with Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar?"" The Goa CM had recently backed beef traders and warned vigilante groups attacking them. Ananda Bhaskar Rapolu (Congress) observed that Swamy was earlier the Commerce Minister and the present-day Ministry has a separate Committee to promote export of beef. ""We are not addressing the real issues. We are just giving an emotional tinge to the aspects with which we can polarise, we can exploit, we can divert,"" Rapolu said. When D Raja of the  (CPI) was speaking, the Railway Minister stood up and alleged that SP's Javed Ali Khan had used some derogatory language and sought that these remarks be expunged. There were heated exchanges between the opposition and treasury benches as Congress leader Jairam Ramesh alleged that Goyal had used a derogatory word. But Kurien said the Minister had made a casual remark. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi defended Goyal, saying the Railway Minister did not say anything against anyone. In his speech, Raja said he opposed to the Bill and took a dig at Swamy, saying some Tamilian friends referred to him as a ""Buddhi Pishaach"". Raja said the cow was being used as a weapon of hate, either in the name of religion or law alleging that the legislation would legitimise cow vigilante groups and encourage mob lynching. He asked the government to make its position clear. Raja also took a jibe at Swamy saying he should advise Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that instead of going for health protection scheme, he should go for cow protection, adding ""I don't know whether the Finance Minister listens to you"". In his response, Swamy claimed that prohibition of cow slaughter is included in the Directive Principles of the Constitution. ""Cow eating was not prevalent during the Mughal period. The last empire was in 1857 when the first thing Bahadur Shah Zafar declared was a ban on cow slaughter...There is anecdotal information that Babur had told his son Humayun not to allow the slaughter of cows. It is a sentimental issue. It is the British who made the cow cutting a part of our regular fashionable cuisine and that is how it became prevalent in our country,"" Swamy said. He claimed that patents have been given for cow urine because the urea that is produced is used in modern medicine. Attacking the Congress, he said ""the first anti-cow sluaghter bill passed was in Madhya Pradesh ...all these Congress people including Dr Rajendra Prasad were in the forefront saying that cow should be give a special place and its killing should be banned,"" Swamy said.",PTI,PTI

"As rival parties fight a bitter poll battle to grab power in this north-eastern hill state, Mizoram's new chief electoral officer (CEO) said the ""biggest challenge"" for him has been to restore public faith in the election process after intense protests by civil society and political groups against his predecessor. Ashish Kundra — who took charge as the new CEO after SB Shashank was removed amid   relief camps to vote from there — has personally visited the bordering Kanhmun village twice after taking charge to oversee the arrangements despite appointing a six-member high-powered team, including an IAS and an IPS officer, for this job. In an interview after taking over on 15 November, Kundra said that the challenge for him was also to ensure that the integrity of the election machinery is not questioned in Mizoram, which will have polling on Wednesday to elect 40 legislators. ""The biggest challenge to begin with was to restore the confidence and trust of the civil society in the institution of the election machinery and to ensure that the integrity of the election machinery is not questioned in the minds of the general electorate,"" he said on-board a chopper travelling from Aizawl to Kanhmun. To handle this issue peacefully, the challenge was to make an arrangement of voting, which is acceptable to both Mizo civil society and Bru refugees, and is also done in a short span of time, Kundra said. ""I interacted with the joint forum of the NGOs soon after taking charge. I interacted with all political parties. Even in Kanhmun village, I interacted with civil society. That created a bit of positivity, which was much required in the given circumstances,"" he added. Declining to comment on decisions made by his predecessor Shashank, Kundra said the series of events that took place in recent times were ""very unfortunate"". ""It is, I think, rather unprecedented. It is also kind of unprecedented that there would be an assault on the election machinery itself, which has been functioning so perfectly for the last so many decades,"" he said. After reaching Kanhmun, which is about 190 kilometres from Aizawl and takes around eight hours by road, Kundra along with his team comprising Additional CEO Krishna Mohan Uppu and Deputy CEO H Lianzela held a series of meetings at a tourist lodge with the six-member team, police and civil society bodies. The team also visited special polling booths, examined the border areas and also went about a kilometre inside Tripura to check the point of getting down from vehicles for the people coming in to vote. Talking about  , Kundra said that 15 special polling booths have been set up for voting by 11,967 Bru refugees, who are part of nine Assembly constituencies in three district of Mizoram. As per the directions of the Election Commission, a special team has been formed under Kumar Abhishek, who has been flown in from Delhi after the crisis, while Assistant Inspector General of Police (Training) Devesh has been made in-charge of security arrangements. The Election Commission overnight airdropped Bhuvanesh Yadav, the Special Secretary of Higher Education to Chhattisgarh government, on Sunday as observer for these 15 booths in view of the sensitivities involved. ""Today is the second time I have visited Kanhmun along with our team. I am perfectly satisfied with the arrangements that have been made to establish the polling stations as directed by the commission. The local community, which is the Young Mizo Association (YMA), has been more than supportive,"" Kundra said. The Mizoram CEO office has arranged transportation for refugees as six camps in the neighbouring state are situated at varying distance of 6-60 km from the border and there is no regular public transport available. Expecting a ""reasonable turnout from the Bru camps"", Kundra said he and his team last week went to the largest camp inside Tripura and interacted with Bru leaders, who were initially reluctant to come to Kanhmun for voting, but later agreed to it as part of a mutually reached solution to the crisis. Talking about general preparedness while on way back to the temporary helipad at Zawlnuam near Kanhmun, Kundra said: ""I have reviewed the preparations across the state. I am confident that the team of district election officers are fully geared up to deliver free, fair and peaceful elections."" Over 11,000 people are involved in this exercise of elections that includes civil administration, polling parties, police personnel and others, he said. Asked about the EVM and VVPAT back-ups, he said: ""We have adequate back-up stocks for any replacements. Usually about 30 percent is back-up, but in some remote areas polling parties are given 100 percent back up also because it is difficult to transport in case of a failure."" During the entire election process, only two show-cause notices have been served — one each to Congress and MNF — for not intimating the administration about the distribution of some pamphlets. For polling on Wednesday, the Election Commission is likely to incur an expenditure of about Rs 30 crore, Kundra said. ""Mizoram not only has the history of holding most peaceful and fair elections, but the election expenditure is also one of the lowest in the country,"" the IAS officer from Chandigarh said after disembarking from the chopper at Aizawl.",Press Trust of India,PTI
"In the latest instance of ceasefire violation by Pakistan, Army jawan Bikas Gurung lost his life in Nowshera on Saturday, 16 June. Sepoy Gurung was killed as Pakistani troopers targeted a patrol party along the Line of Control in the Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir. Rifleman Gurung was grievously injured in the firing and succumbed to injuries. The 21-year-old soldier belonged to Khunka Khuki village of Manipur and is survived by his mother, reported PTI. The latest instance of ceasefire violation comes after four BSF personnel, including an assistant commandant-rank officer, were killed in firing by Pakistani Rangers along the International Border in Samba district on June 13. Owing to the continuous ceasefire violations by Pakistan, the Border Security Force (BSF) troops and Pakistani Rangers did not exchange sweets at the Attari Wagah border on Eid this year. In May, Home Minister Rajnath Singh had announced suspension of operations in Jammu and Kashmir during the holy month of Ramzan. It was clarified that operations would resume in case the security forces came under attack. As the deadline ends on Saturday, the government is yet to decide whether the ceasefire will be extended. News18 reported Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir as saying that the decision on whether or not to extend the Ramzan ceasefire has not been taken yet. The killing of senior journalist Shujaat Bukhari in Srinagar, on 14 June, is likely to impact the government’s decision on the ceasefire status.

" Jammu and Kashmir Congress president GA Mir on Saturday expressed doubt over the holding of panchayat and local bodies elections in the state, saying the party would clear its stand after a review meeting next week.

""Yesterday, the administration set up a high-level committee to review the ground situation…I feel the elections will be postponed on some pretext or other whether it is rain, snow or winter,"" Mir told reporters in Jammu.

" Anubhav Mishra  Purnendu Pritam When we talk about financial investments, one of the first things that comes to mind is mutual fund investments. Mutual fund investments are the talk of the town these days. Whether it’s your colleagues, associates or people you meet at a party, everyone seems to be excited about mutual funds. But, they are not experts and hence, often have incomplete information. In this episode of Dhan Ki Baat, financial expert Gaurav Mashruwala will demystify the concept of mutual fund investment for you. Let’s try to understand this with an example. Suppose you decide to go on a trip with your friends but are unable to decide upon the destination. So, you go to a tour operator, who as per your preferences and budget chalks out a tour plan. The operator also takes care of all the arrangements that need to be made and since, the tour was planned for a group of people rather than a single person, it is less expensive for you. Mutual funds also work along the same line. In this analogy, a mutual fund is a tour operator, who picks a right fund for you, manages it, and it is less expensive than other investments. Mutual funds investments are typically of three types – equity fund, gold fund and debt fund. Let’s start with equity funds. Under these mutual fund schemes, your invest in share market. Under gold funds, as the name suggests, you invest in gold. The value of your investments rises or dips based on the value of gold in the market. Debt funds involve those mutual fund schemes that invest in bonds, government securities etc. If you think that investment in just one type of fund may be too much of a risk, you can try hybrid funds. These are schemes in which your investments are done through a combination of different mutual fund schemes. For example, if you have a part of investment in equity fund and another part of it in debt fund, then it’s a hybrid fund. Most of the people just assume that mutual fund schemes are sound investments where a good return is guaranteed. However, this is not entirely true. Suppose you invested in gold fund. If the cost of gold drops, then your investment will yield a negative return. But, if you keep investing in the mutual funds on a regular basis over a significant period of time, the likelihood of a good return increases. Mutual funds schemes are regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India). There are checks and balance in place by this regulatory body to ensure that the company or experts managing your mutual funds don’t make independent decisions as per their own will.

"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is facing arguably its biggest electoral crisis ever as reports say the Election Commission has recommended to the president the   of 20 of its MLAs for allegedly holding an office of profit. However, this is by no means the first controversy of its kind. Perhaps the most prominent instance of a political imbroglio over an office of profit was regarding no less than former Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The former Congress president in March 2006   as a member of Parliament after the Opposition raised an outcry over her holding the post of chairperson of the National Advisory Council (NAC). In the aftermath of her resignation, two more members of Parliament—Karan Singh and Gurudas Kamat—also quit, according to a report by   was formed on 4 June, 2004 after the Congress-led UPA came to power, defeating the BJP-led NDA. Sonia Gandhi was the chairperson of the body until it was dissolved in May 2014. Later, the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959  was amended to add the post of the NAC chairperson to the list of exempted post. The outcry against Sonia Gandhi was fuelled by the disqualification of Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan. Bachchan was disqualified as she held the office of the chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council, as reported by  The action taken against Jaya Bachchan led Opposition parties launching an attack on Sonia Gandhi. More recently, two Uttar Pradesh MLAs—Bajrang Bahadur Singh and Uma Shankar Singh—were disqualified from the state Assembly after they were found to be holding offices of profit,  . While the former was from the Bharatiya Janata Party, the latter was from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). A Lokayukta probe against them had at the time held them guilty of having taken up government contracts worth several hundred crores of rupees. While upholding their disqualification, the Supreme Court in April 2015 held that legislators will be disqualified not only if they have business contracts with the government at the time of filing of their nomination papers, but also if they have such contracts after being elected,   reported.

"Taking BJP's fight against Congress to the Gandhi family's home turf, party president Amit Shah held a public rally in Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's constituency Raebareli, where he said that BJP would free Raebareli and Amethi of ""family rule"". Shah addressed the rally in Raebareli on Saturday, where party workers from neighbouring areas including Congress president Rahul Gandhi's constituency Amethi, attended the programme. Though the Bharatiya Janata Party swept Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 General Elections to Lok Sabha, BJP lost both Raebareli and Amethi to Congress. Shah's efforts in Raebareli, which include meetings with party workers to review the BJP's preparedness for the 2019 general elections, seem to be an effort to wrest Raebareli and Amethi from the Opposition party. At the rally, Shah also referred to the upcoming 12 May  , where he spoke of his confidence that the saffron party would put up a good show in the state. ""I have just returned from Karnataka, the mood is clearly in the favour of BJP,"" the BJP chief said. Shah was referring to his   to Karnataka that started on 12 April. BJP, which came to power for the first time in the southern state in 2008, lost to Congress in the May 2013 Assembly elections after BS Yeddyurappa had parted ways and formed the Karnataka Janata Party. Yeddyurappa had returned to the party a year later and had won from the Shivamogga Lok Sabha seat in the May 2014 General Elections to Lok Sabha. The Raebareli rally saw BJP leaders relentlessly criticising Congress for failing to do enough for Raebareli and Amethi constituencies. ""Congress fooled people in the name of development,"" Shah said at the rally. ""It was the Narendra Modi government which pushed development in Uttar Pradesh and Raebareli,"" he added. Shah asserted that Raebareli's people sent several ""big leaders"" to Delhi, but they did not bring any development to the area. ""Raebareli has seen ' ' (family rule), and not development right since Independence,"" Shah said. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who also spoke at the rally, said Congress failed to bring development to Raebareli and Amethi. ""People of Raebareli and Amethi are suffering under Congress,"" Adityanath said. The party, under Modi and Shah, has been making a determined bid to wrest Amethi from Congress. It pitted Union minister Smriti Irani against the Gandhi scion in Amethi in the last Lok Sabha elections. Irani, who has been regularly visiting Amethi and has taken various developmental initiatives there, is likely to be the party's candidate from the constituency in the next general election as well. UP BJP general secretary Pankaj Singh also fired a salvo against the Opposition party, saying the Congress chief must answer as to why the people in the constituencies represented by him and his family members in the Parliament were crying for basic amenities even after so many years of Independence. ""The BJP government in the state under Adityanath is working on the ' ' (pledge) of ensuring availability of electricity and water supply and construction of better roads in the village. When they (Congress) were in power, they had never felt it appropriate to answer to anyone,"" Singh also said to  Shah and Adityanath also spoke of the slew of schemes the government has implemented for Uttar Pradesh. ""Adityanth restored law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh, which was notorious for goons and guns,"" Shah said at the rally. He also said that the chief minister had managed to make the state ""pothole-free"". The BJP leaders also urged Congress to apologise for its ""accusations"" against them. Shah said that Rahul owed them an apology after the  . ""I ask Rahul, you tried to defame Hindu culture by claiming about ‘saffron terror’, now you should apologise to the nation. Asmeeanand  has been cleared of the charge,"" Shah said in Raebareli. Adityanath also said that both Sonia and Rahul should apologise to Shah for their allegations on him in the Justice Loya case. Shah also spoke of the   that had broken out at the venue of the public meeting. ""When something big is about to happen some obstacles do come on the way,"" the BJP chief said about the incident.  The fire, which was brought under control in a short time, broke out due to an electrical short-circuit near the media enclosure, officials had said.  ",FP Staff,FP Staff
" BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday attacked the state government's proposal to give 12 percent quota to Muslims, saying his party will never allow it as religion-based reservation is unconstitutional. Shah hit out at Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) chief and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao over the issue during campaign rallies at Parkal and Nirmal ahead of the 7 December Assembly polls in the state. ""I want to tell Chandrasekhar Rao, the Supreme Court has fixed 50 percent ceiling (on total reservations). If you want to provide 12 percent reservation, from whose quota are you going to carve it out: from Dalits, tribals or OBCs? Decide this first,"" Shah said. Shah said Rao promised reservation to the minority community ""despite being aware"" of the 50 percent ceiling and forwarded the proposal (Bill) to the Centre. ""BJP would stand firmly to protect the reservation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes,"" he said. The Constitution does not allow reservation based on religion, the BJP chief said. He asked the gathering whether a religion-based reservation should be be given, and said, ""You don't worry. Even if KCR, Congress, TDP, communists, all of them come together, I guarantee that till the BJP government is at the Centre, religion-based reservation will not be given."" The Telangana legislature has passed a Bill increasing reservations in jobs and education for backward sections of the Muslim community to 12 percent from the earlier four percent. The Bill is yet to get the Centre's nod. Meanwhile, speaking at a campaign rally at Shadnagar, Rao said the bill was not yet cleared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite repeated requests. ""We want to give reservations to Muslims. But Modi is against that. That is the reason I am advocating a non-Congress and non-BJP front government. You know that I fought for Telangana's statehood. I will get you reservations the same way,"" he said.",Press Trust of India,PTI
": BJP president Amit Shah Tuesday sought to project the forthcoming elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as a contest between ""individual-centric"" parties and those driven by ideologies. He said the elections in the three states can ""change the nation"". Addressing a convention of youths in Gwalior, the Bharatiya Janata Party chief said the parties that lack leadership and policies cannot provide a stable government. ""Upcoming elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan will prove to be ones that can change the nation because the contest will decide whether people elect parties which are individual-centric or those driven by ideology,"" Shah said in an apparent reference to political dynasties. Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in the next two months in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram. While first three of the above states are currently ruled by the BJP, the Congress is in power in the northeastern state. Telangana was ruled by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) before Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao dissolved the assembly. Lok Sabha elections are slated to be held next year. ""How is it possible for these parties to provide a strong government when they don't have any leader and even their policies are not yet decided,"" Shah said. Targetting the Congress, he said the only agenda of that party is ""Modi Hatao"" (defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi) in contrast to the PM's goal of ""eradicating poverty and corruption"" from the country. He said the BJP is the only party where an ordinary worker can go on to become a prime minister or a chief minister of a state. ""This is the reason why a tea-seller has become the prime minister of our country... Is this possible in Congress, BSP or SP? The main aim of the opposition parties is to make their sons and daughters an MLA or an MP and there is no place for an ordinary worker to claim these positions,"" he said. Shah said most political parties in the country lacked ""democracy"". ""How can leaders of such parties will protect democracy of the nation?"" he asked. ""In such a scenario, there is no possibility of any development in the country. The Congress ruled for 55 years but failed to usher in development,"" Shah said. Referring to the prime minister's ambitious schemes that are aimed at providing power and toilets in every village of the country, Shah said the Modi government is working hard to fulfil this objective. Before addressing the convention, Shah visited memorials of Rani Lakshmibai and Vijayaraje Scindia, popularly known as 'Rajmata'. The Scindia family had ruled Gwalior state during the pre-independence period. ""Those people who lived for the country can only inspire the youth,"" he said. Referring to the 2016 Uri attack and subsequent surgical strike, Shah said, ""Within 10 days of the attack at (the Army camp in) Uri, Indian soldiers entered Pakistan and killed terrorists"". Shah said Madhya Pradesh was brought out of BIMARU tag and turned into a developed state by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The BJP chief also took potshots at the state Congress which is known to be a divided house. ""The Congress has not yet decided on its chief ministerial face while in the BJP, Shivraj Singh Chouhan will become a chief minister again,"" he said. Similarly, it is not yet clear who will be the Opposition leader in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but Narendra Modi will become prime minister again from the BJP, he said. Earlier in the day, Shah addressed party workers in Shivpuri and conducted a roadshow in Guna, the Lok Sabha constituency of senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia.",Press Trust of India,Press Trust of India
"The government will make a fresh push for the passage of the contentious triple talaq bill in Parliament's Budget Session starting Monday but is likely to meet strong resistance from the Opposition, which had stalled it in the last session, political leaders said. The session will open with the customary address of the president to a joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Following the address by President Ram Nath Kovind, the economic survey will be tabled in the two Houses. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will present the current BJP-led NDA regime's last full-fledged budget on 1 February. The first spell of the session will end on 9 February. Parliament will meet again between 5 March and 6 April. The budget is likely to carry a strong political message with an emphasis on farmers and the poor and an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Besides the budget priorities, it is the government's legislative agenda which is likely to witness strong protests from the Opposition. It will also seek to corner the government during the debate on the 'Motion of Thanks to the President's Address' over a host of issues, including unemployment, farm distress and communal clashes, opposition leaders said. The President's address, which projects the government's points of view, is likely to focus on the Centre's efforts at boosting economic and farm growth, creating employment and empowering the poor and other weaker sections of society. Besides the triple talaq legislation, which criminalises instant talaq by Muslim men, the government is also likely to make a pitch for the passage of the OBC bill, which seeks to give a constitutional status to the OBC commission. Both bills are politically significant for the BJP which is a strong votary of the abolition of instant triple talaq among Muslims, a practice declared void by the Supreme Court last year. The Lok Sabha had passed the bill seeking imprisonment for Muslim men convicted of practising instant triple talaq, but a united Opposition had stalled it in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA lacks a majority. The BJP also hopes to consolidate its support among backward classes by according constitutional status to the OBC commission, which, it believes, will give it more teeth.",PTI,PTI

"Telugu Desam Party legislators on Tuesday voted in favour of ending the party’s alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party for refusing to financially help Andhra Pradesh,   reported. The lawmakers voiced their opinion during an impromptu poll that Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu held during a legislature party meeting in Amaravati. The two ministers from the TDP in Narendra Modi’s Cabinet – Ashok Gajapathi Raju and YS Chowdhary – may even resign from their posts,   reported. “CM Naidu is now all set to take steps to end the alliance,” the daily quoted an unidentified TDP leader as saying. “It will begin with the two central ministers stepping down, most likely on March 10. Withdrawing support to the NDA government at the Centre is likely to happen in the next few days after the two ministers resign.” At the party meeting, Naidu claimed that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had “cold shouldered” a delegation led by state Finance Minister Y Ramakrishnudu on Monday evening,   reported.  “Jaitley not only refused to acknowledge any of demands put forward, including the request to release funds to bridge the revenue deficit gap of over Rs 16,000 crore, but also said there was no question of granting Special Category Status and that there was very little fund left to give under the special package announced in 2017 as most of the funds have already been given,” the chief minister said. “This attitude is very disparaging and unacceptable. We have time and again told the Centre that Special Category Status is our right as we have suffered immensely due to the unscientific and irrational bifurcation of the state.” Andhra Pradesh, Naidu added, requires “hand-holding by the Centre” for a few years to ensure that it can compete with other states in the region. “But we are not getting response from the Centre. So should we continue in this alliance with the BJP?” TDP legislators demanding special status for the state have disrupted proceedings in Parliament for the last two days. On Tuesday, the TDP and the YSR Congress held a   at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi during which Congress President Rahul Gandhi promised to grant the state special status if his party is voted to power in the 2019 General Elections. The BJP, meanwhile, is bracing for the alliance with TDP to collapse. “We are committed to the development of Andhra Pradesh and have done everything possible to help the state government,” an unidentified leader was quoted as saying by  . “But we cannot meet impossible demands.

" BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday assured Other Backward Classes (OBC) that the Narendra Modi government would ensure passage of the OBC bill in Parliament despite Congress' opposition to it. ""How much ever the Congress tries to oppose or create an obstacle, the Narendra Modi government at the Centre will pass the OBC Bill in both houses of Parliament. This is our decision and we will see to it that the community gets justice,"" he said addressing an OBC convention. Shah said the Congress had created an obstacle in passing the bill in the Rajya Sabha, demanding induction of an OBC representative in the Commission. He said the Modi government, which believes in the welfare of all communities, had done enough for OBCs. ""We have brought several schemes for all communities, including OBCs. Schemes such as Mudra Bank, Ujwal, Saubhagya and Pradhan Mantri Yojana, among others, have been implemented. These schemes have reached the beneficiaries,"" he said. Under the Mudra scheme, about 50 lakh OBC youth had availed loans of the total of nearly one crore people who had availed of it, he said. Also as many as one lakh poor OBC women have been provided gas connections, he added. Apparently referring to the Siddaramaiah government's move on  , Shah alleged that Congress was adopting the divide and rule policy of the British and creating a wedge between communities. On the other hand, the Modi government has been working for the welfare of all communities, including OBCs, with its development agenda of 'Sabka-Saath-Sabka-Vikas,' he said. In a move weeks before the 12 May Assembly polls, the state Cabinet recently decided to recommend to the Centre to grant religious minority tag to the politically powerful Lingayats and Veerashaiva Lingayats. Shah also assured the people that the killers of RSS and BJP workers would be hunted down 'even from the abyss' and imprisoned. ""How much ever Congress makes an effort to protect the killers of RSS and BJP workers, the next government under Yeddyurappa's stewardship will hunt them down even from the abyss and send them to jail,"" he said.

""The country is facing issues related to unemployment, farmers' issues, adivasis, Dalit issues. People in big cities face other issues. But in his entire speech, Narendra Modi did not speak of the coming future. He did not speak on providing employment, helping out the farmers,"" the Congress leader said. Rahul compared Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah's rule with that of Modi's. ""When Siddaramaiah drives the car of Karnataka, he looks in the forward direction. When there's a car approaching, he sees it. Modi ji, instead, looks in the rear-view mirror when he drives a car. He looks in the rearview mirror the entire day. When there's a pothole, the car meets with an accident. Modiji, you have to look forward, not backward,"" he said.   Rahul lashed out at Modi for using the Congress as an ""excuse"". ""The country has not elected you to have excuses, or to look in the rear-view mirror. Because when you look into rear-view mirror, you make mistakes like GST and demonetisation. When you look into it, you give 'Gabbar Singh Tax' to the nation,"" he told the gathering.

He toured the entire country and claimed that he changed Gujarat. But I saw the reality with my own eyes when I toured the state. If anybody has changed Gujarat, then it is the farmers, small entrepreneurs, and labourers.""

Calling the   ""the biggest issue"" in India today, Rahul said, ""Modi went to France and changed the contract himself. First the contract was given to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). HAL has been making aircrafts for the country for 70 years. If Bengaluru stands on its feet today, it is because of HAL.

I request you to give support those who are true to you.  The Congress has been truthful to you and shown how work can be done.

"The Maharashtra government is planning to enact a law to encourage intercaste and inter-religion marriages and focus on giving protection to such couples, in the backdrop of instances of honour killing. The couples – where spouses are from different religions or castes – have to face various problems, including social boycott and the threat of honour killing, state social justice minister Rajkumar Badole told PTI. ""Hence, besides other aspects, the law will focus on what kind of protection can be given to the couples who are facing threat to their lives,"" he said. The minister said while there is already a Special Marriage Act (for inter-religious marriages), it has various lacunae that need to be addressed. In the existing laws, if one of the spouse is from a backward community and another from the general category, the child born to them is deprived of the benefits of reservations and other concessions (given to the backward classes), Badole said. “The government intends to provide to the children of such couples the benefits that one of their parents is already getting,” he said. Apart from that, the government will provide special concessions such as fee waiver to the children born out of intercaste and inter-religion marriages, he added. There are various schemes that promote intercaste and inter-religion marriages but they are not properly implemented, he noted.

" Mohd Ibrahim A day after the father of an 18-year-old woman, who has alleged rape by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his brothers, died in custody in Unnao, one of the brothers of the lawmaker – Atul Singh – was arrested in connection with the incident. Along with Atul Singh, three others were also arrested, reported ANI. Meanwhile, accused MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar dubbed the charges against him as a conspiracy, saying that the complainant belonged to a ""low-class"". Speaking to ANI on Tuesday, 10 April, the woman who has levelled rape allegations against Sengar said: The death of her father prompted the woman to put the blame on the lawmaker. He was ""killed at the behest of the BJP MLA"" inside the jail, she alleged. ""We were getting threats and they killed my father,"" she told the media. Moreover, a day before his death, the woman and her family attempted suicide outside Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s residence. The woman had even tried to immolate herself outside Adityanath’s office on 8 April. The woman's father, aged around 50, was rushed to a hospital from the district jail on the night of 8 April and died during treatment on Monday, officials told PTI. He had been arrested on 5 April under the Arms Act, they added. On Monday, 9 April, Adityanath responded to the father’s death, saying that he has asked the Lucknow Additional Director General Rajeev Kumar to probe the matter. Those responsible will not be spared, he added. The Unnao SP said six policemen, including Makhi SHO Ashok Kumar Singh, the outpost in-charge and four beat constables were suspended. According to Inspector General of Police Praveen Kumar, a magisterial probe has been ordered to investigate his death. Significantly, a case had been registered against four persons a few days back on a complaint by the deceased's wife that he was beaten up. In the meantime, Sengar, who represents the Bangermau constituency in Unnao, has rejected the charges against him as conspiracy by his opponents, saying that the complainant belonged to a ""low-class"". Speaking to the media, he demanded a high-level inquiry and sought action against those guilty. “Let a probe be conducted, and the guilty be given the stringent punishment. If I am found guilty in the probe, I am ready to face punishment,” he said. To a question whether he will resign, Sengar said: Later on 9 April, a copy of the FIR registered in the rape case revealed that Sengar’s name was not mentioned in it, reported ANI. The sister of the survivor, on Monday, demanded that the MLA and his brother, Atul Singh, be named in the FIR and arrested. Congress president Rahul Gandhi had lashed out at the Yogi Adityanth-led government in UP on Monday, questioning the father’s alleged “custodial” death, and asking why the MLA had not been arrested yet. An unverified video of the victim’s father in the custody of police had also gone viral. In the video, one can see the man with injuries, due to which he allegedly passed away. Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police OP Singh had said that a team has been formed to investigate the death of the rape survivor’s father, and that the accused would be arrested. “He was admitted to hospital last night by the police after he complained of abdominal pain and vomiting. He passed away early morning,” Dr Atul of District Hospital, Unnao, told ANI. The woman had attempted suicide by pouring kerosene on herself after alleging rape by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar. No action had been taken regarding the matter despite several complaints to the police and the party, she said. The rape had allegedly taken place in May 2017. Speaking to ANI, the woman alleged:  reported that the woman had moved court under Section 156 (3) of the CrPC in an attempt to get an FIR registered against Sengar. However, on 2 April, supporters of the MLA reportedly barged inside the woman’s house and beat up her father and brother in retaliation.

"Trashing the Congress party's allegations over the Rafale deal, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said that the Opposition party is peddling ""lies after lies.""

Scaling up the government's response to  , Goyal claimed that the nation is witnessing the work of a ""serial liar"" who is completely twisting the narrative to hide the fact that the Congress is an ""issue-less party."" ""We have of late been experiencing the activities of a serial liar. Only an issue-less man can repeat a lie again and again. Beating a dead horse won't get them any public sympathy Even if a lie is repeated 100 times, it can never substitute the truth,"" Goyal said. Countering the Congress' claims, Goyal said: ""The first lie by Mr Rahul Gandhi is before the nation and the world. He twisted a French media house's report on Rafale, which the CEO of Dassault has himself said was a blatant twisting of facts."" ""The Congress lied in Parliament too, where Rahul said he personally met the French president and asked him about the secrecy of the Rafale deal. It only shows the hollowness of his knowledge that he does not know that the secrecy pact was done in 2008 by his own government under then prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh,"" Goyal claimed. According to Goyal, other ""lies"" included the Congress' claims that the deal had an angle of one Indian company financing a film of the then French president's associate, and the entire ""falsehood"" about the offset clause. ""The second lie was their attempt to twist the Supreme Court judgement. The Supreme Court has refused to discuss the price and technical details of Rafale, which are sensitive and highly confidential, in the interest of our national security,"" Goyal said. ""Another lie that the ex-French president called our prime minister a thief is the worst diplomatic gaffe that a senior political leader could do. It is shameful, that in their desperation, they are involving world leaders and threatening India's ties with a friendly country,"" Goyal contended. Repeating Dassault's claims, Goyal said that the French company accepted that they finalised a company with whom they were in touch since 2012 of their own volition and choice. Goyal also sought to distance the central government from controversy over Reliance Defence, claiming that the government did not have any official communication as to which company was entrusted with what role under the offset obligation. The offset obligations are part of the Rafale deal, under which India will purchase 36 Rafale fighter aircraft and in return, Dassault is obligated to bring business to Indian companies relating to but not limited to the service and maintenance of the aircraft. Dassault has said that besides Reliance Defence, it is also in touch with nearly 100 other Indian firms which are its offset partners. The railway minister further said that the Congress is possibly trying to hide its own misdemeanours with respect to compromising national security. He claimed that the UPA government had cancelled the much-needed Rafale deal because the makers did not agree to give business to ""Congress' first family's close associate Mr Sanjay Bhandari."" Goyal also sought to portray the current terms of the deal ""100 times better"" than the previous government. He further claimed that the random price brackets being quoted by Rahul Gandhi are akin to comparing a ""seed with an entire orchard of apples."" ""The current government negotiated terms which are far better than what was agreed by the UPA in 2007 and 2012. We have gotten faster delivery, longer maintenance tenure, better availability of spare parts and much needed defence capabilities in the Rafale fighter jets, which will come ready to fly,"" Goyal said.

"Making a U-turn, BJP's Nagaland unit on Tuesday, 30 January, backed out of a joint declaration signed on Monday by all parties in the state to boycott the upcoming Assembly polls which also led to suspension of a state party leader.

" The revamp of the global tennis structure's second tier – the ATP Challenger Tour – from 2019 will hit Indian players hard with the complete removal of ATP ranking points in the lower level of the men's circuit, according to Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association's Sunder Iyer. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) events with prize money of USD 25,000 and below will offer no ATP ranking points from next year, according to the MSLTA's secretary. With there being no ranking points for USD 15,000 and below events for women too and points restricted to the last four in the higher USD 25,000 ITF events, the women players too will take a hit, Iyer indicated. ""Currently there are around 60 Indian men and women players who are ranked by the ATP and WTA. But next year, because of the revamp of the tennis structure, this would come down to less than 20,"" Iyer told PTI on Thursday. Countries and cities hosting tournaments will have to factor in higher costs to hold Challenger events as it will be a draw of 48, instead of the current 32, which will further inflate the budget as all 48 players in the main draw will have to be provided with hospitality and prize money, according to Iyer.

": In the wake of recovery of an alleged Maoist letter suggesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the target of an assassination plot, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said the BJP was trying to generate sympathy by playing a ""threat letter card"". Speaking at a function marking the 19th anniversary of the NCP as well as the culmination of the party's 'Halla Bol' campaign, Pawar said the people would not fall prey to the BJP's attempts to generate sympathy. A string of rallies and protests were held under the NCP's 'Halla Bol' campaign against the BJP-led Maharashtra government. According to police probing the 1 January Bhima-Koregaon caste violence, a letter found in the house of a person arrested for  alleged Maoist links talks about the ultras mulling a ""Rajiv Gandhi-type incident"", and suggesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi be targeted during his ""roadshows"". The letter was recovered from the house of Rona Wilson who was among five people arrested arrested from Mumbai, Nagpur and Delhi in connection with 'Elgar Parishad' held in Pune in December and the subsequent Bhima-Koregaon violence in the district. Pawar alleged the government was branding some ""progressive"" people as ""Naxalites"" for organising the event. ""Some progressive people in Pune came together and organised the Elgar Parishad. Now, the government is arresting some of them and branding them Naxalites. ""Everyone knows who were behind the Bhima Koregaon (violence) but instead of arresting them, those who have no connection have been arrested. This is called misuse of power,"" the former Union minister said. NCP stalwart Chhagan Bhujbal, who was released on bail last month in a money laundering case, also attended the event. ""The BJP has realised that they are losing popular support. In order to gain sympathy, the BJP is now playing the threat letter card. However, I am sure that the people will not fall prey to such tactics,"" Pawar said. The veteran politician, who is trying to project himself as the pivot to unite Opposition parties to take on the BJP in the 2019 polls, intensified his attack on the BJP in last few weeks. Pawar also raised doubts about the veracity of the threat letter. ""I have spoken to a senior retired police officer who told me that when such letters come they do not go to media but to the security agencies which make sure that adequate security measures are taken,"" the former chief minister said. He said the BJP's graph is going down across the country. Appreciating Bhujbal's work as former PWD minister, Pawar said the Maharashtra Sadan building in Delhi is a ""fine example"" of modern structure, as even the prime minister holds a meeting there. Maharashtra Sadan was at the centre of a money laundering case against Bhujbal who is accused of having received kickbacks from a developer in lieu of awarding the contract for constructing the building. ""It is unfortunate that the person who did an excellent job by constructing such a structure was put behind bars,"" Pawar said, referring to Bhujbal's two-year jail term. Similarly, veteran Congress leader P Chidambaram, who had done an outstanding job as finance minister, is being ""falsely implicated,"" he alleged. Referring to glitches in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during the Bhandara-Gondiya Lok Sabha bypoll last month, Pawar claimed the Election Commission, on a complaint of the NCP, gave in writing that 64 EVms were not working. ""They (BJP) are trying to manipulate EVMs to win elections, as they have understood that they would not be able to win the elections in a democratic manner,"" he alleged. Pawar said he was appealing to all ""like-minded parties barring the BJP"" to approach the Chief Election Commissioner for discarding EVMs and bringing back the old system of paper ballot. Speaking about building a common platform against the BJP before the 2019 polls, the NCP chief said, ""All like-minded parties should come together. The NCP has already taken a lead to reach out to such parties,"" he said. Pawar also offered a 'Phule Pagadi', a traditional turban named after the 19th century social reformer Jyotiba Phule, to Bhujbal, a prominent OBC leader.

He also sought a direction restraining the Centre as well as State government from raising a memorial for her in the present site of burial. S Jayaseelan, 48, had filed the case on the ground that Jayalalithaa had been convicted in a corruption case and therefore burying the remains of a convict on the beach was against public morality. “No convict should be given a State honour.

"Addressing the media on four years of the NDA government, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Monday, 28 May, lauded the success of its “unprecedented outreach and unparalleled outcomes” policy at the global stage, outlining how this government has reached out to 186 out of 192 countries across the world. Outlining the work of the Narendra Modi-led government in its four years of rule, Swaraj said India has secured membership of three export control regimes out of four since this government came to power in 2014.

" The Congress demanded on Saturday that Goa governor Mridula Sinha summon a special session of the legislative Assembly and ask the BJP-led coalition government to prove its majority. The Opposition party, which has been claiming that the state government is in disarray in the absence of ailing Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar from office, alleged that it ""is a classic case of fraud being played on the people of Goa by the Governor and the BJP at the Centre"". Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters in Panaji that the party would raise this issue during the upcoming winter session of Parliament and also before President Ram Nath Kovind. The Congress had submitted representations to the president and the Goa governor, claiming that the party had the requisite number of MLAs to prove majority in the 40-member House. ""We will put pressure on the central leadership of the BJP in winter session and also before the President for our demand to summon a special session to prove majority,"" he said. Accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Goa of holding the Constitution ""captive"", Surjewala said the formation of the Cabinet Advisory Committee by the BJP in absence of Parrikar is a ""blatant fraud on the Constitution"". In the 40-member Goa Assembly, the Parrikar government has the support of 23 MLAs. These comprise 14 BJP MLAs, three each from the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party as well as three Independents. Surjewala said the coalition government should prove its majority and lay down a roadmap for governance and administration. The government should also settle issues like Regional Plan, mining, unemployment, he demanded. ""This will clear all doubts about who is in-charge in Goa and the floor test will determine as to which party has the rightful claim to head a democratic government in people's interest in Goa,"" he added. Surjewala questioned the effectiveness of state government in absence of Parrikar, who is currently recuperating at his residence here after undergoing treatment at AIIMS in Delhi. Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane had said that Parrikar was suffering from pancreatic cancer. Surjewala alleged, ""Constitution is being held captive because of the BJP's lust for power. Formation of a Cabinet Advisory Committee (CAC) by the BJP is a blatant fraud on the Constitution itself."" ""It negates the constitutionally conferred powers of the state cabinet under Articles 163, 164, 166."" Surjewala alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah were responsible for the ""political and administration mess"" in Goa by allowing an ailing Parrikar to continue in chair. ""Paralysed governance, crippled administration and collapse of authority has become symbolical of the chaos prevailing in the BJP government in Goa,"" he claimed. Wishing Parrikar speedy recovery, Surjewala recalled that party president Rahul Gandhi had inquired about the chief minister's health last month. ""On account of incapacity of the CM owing to his illness, power brokers are running amok and are plundering the state's resources and holding democracy to ransom,"" he alleged. Surjewala said that the BJP held a meeting of Cabinet ministers of Goa in AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) in Delhi on October 12, where Parrikar was undergoing treatment. ""This has never happened in the history of Goa. On October 31, 2018, the official Twitter handle of the Goa CM posted a picture of that Cabinet meeting,"" he said. ""The people of Goa were deeply disturbed by the visual in that picture. It reflects that Parrikar needs emergent medical attention rather than the grand-standing by the BJP,"" he said. He said key governance issues were being dragged due to BJP's ""misgovernance"" in Goa. ""The mess created by the BJP by stoppage of mining, closure of businesses of small traders and mismanagement of sand mining has affected the entire state,"" he claimed. The Congress had earlier questioned non-issuance of medical bulletins on health of Parrikar. ""If the CM is fine, as per the press statements, then why is he refusing to meet even the Leader of Opposition and MLAs and interact with them?"" Surjewala asked. Recently, Subhash Shirodkar and Dayanad Sopte resigned as Congress MLAs and joined the BJP, bringing down the strength of the opposition party to 14 in Goa Assembly.",Press Trust of India,Press Trust of India
"The Congress on Tuesday   a video in which Union minister Nitin Gadkari is seen claiming that his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, made “tall promises” before coming to power. The Congress said it was “good to see Gadkari concurring with our view that the government was built on jumlas [gimmicks] and fake promises”. In another  , Congress President Rahul Gandhi said Gadkari was right, and the public also believes that the government had made their dreams and faith a victim of its greed. In the video clip, Gadkari reportedly says in response to a question on the government’s unfulfilled promises: “Politics is a game of compulsions, limitations and contradictions.” Talking about the 2014 election campaign, he adds: We were very confident that we can never come to power. So our people suggested us, just to make tall promises. If we come to power, we won’t be responsible anyway! Now the problem is that people have voted us to power. Now people remind us of our promises along with dates. Nowadays we just laugh and move on.”   The video is taken from a new comedy television show called  , which aired on Colors channel on October 5. A clip from the show, labelled “When politics meets cinema”, is available on a  . The show has actor Nana Patekar interviewing Gadkari. Patekar is facing allegations of sexual harassment from actor Tanushree Dutta.

We look at the person’s caste and whether he is a candidate who can win.” He also claims: “We approach doctors, engineers asking them to contest elections. But they refuse. Then we say, honest people like you do not wish to enter politics. Then why do you protest when the dishonest become politicians?” Gadkari then recalls that the Muslim community had organised a programme for him in Nagpur in 2014, which was attended by 10,000 people. “Remember, I am a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,” the minister says he told the audience. “Don’t feel sorry after you vote for me. And you have known me for 25 years. Don’t vote for me if I seek votes based on caste and religion.” The Union minister said he subsequently won 40% of the vote in the constituency in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Gadkari also claims on the show that he is not a politician. “Every politician thinks of his next election,” he says. “[But] every socioeconomic reformer thinks from century to century.” However, Gadkari on Wednesday denied making such comments,   reported. “This is false, I did not say anything on Modi ji or the BJP or Rs 15 lakh,” he said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pre-poll promise to bring back black money from abroad and deposit Rs 15 lakh in every citizen’s bank account. He added, “The programme was in Marathi and I wonder since when has Rahul ji starting understanding Marathi.” Questioning the translation where it first appeared in an English newspaper, Gadkari described it as “baseless”. : Union Minister Nitin Gadkari clarifies on his earlier reported statement that 'BJP overpromised in 2014 elections'.

"Senior Congress leader and Supreme Court advocate Brijesh Kalappa has ruled himself out of the reckoning for Karnataka's Madikeri seat in the upcoming Assembly election, saying he wants to get the seat ""for the right reasons"", and not because the party's original choice for the seat, HS Chandramouli, had once represented absconding businessman Mehul Choksi. Kalappa took to Facebook to post a detailed message, a day after the party put the seat on hold. On Tuesday, party sources had said it would announce its candidate for Madikeri  , following a furore raised by Opposition parties who objected to Chandramouli's pick to contest from the seat because he represented Choksi in an earlier case back in 2016. Following the Congress' denial of a ticket to him, Kalappa said, he was approached by 2-3 spokespersons from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who claimed to have batted on behalf of him. ""I thank them from the bottom of my heart for their genuine concern in the larger interest of collegiality even while belonging to different political parties,"" he said. But he turned down the BJP's offer of help, saying he has ""complete confidence"" in the Congress leadership. ""But with the greatest humility, it is not appropriate to take BJP's help to obtain justice in the Congress. I have complete confidence in the Congress and its leadership that it will give me my due in course of time,"" he added. But while   at having lost his seat to Chandramouli, he insisted that the latter shouldn't be denied the ticket because of his association with Choksi, since it happened way before allegations of financial fraud were leveled against the businessman. ""If I appeared for a person, say in 2010, could I be implicated if that person became involved in a crime in 2018? No. It appears that the facts with regards to Chandramouli appearing for Mehul Choksi are much the same,"" he said. Choksi, as    , had retained the services of Chandramouli in 2016 when he was accused of cheating by Bengaluru-based businessman SV Hariprasad. Two years later, Choksi, with his nephew Nirav Modi, was among the accused in a scam related to alleged cheating of the Punjab National Bank to the tune of about $2 billion. But Kalappa said his conscience wouldn't permit him to accept Congress' ticket if it were to be denied to Chandramouli under the present circumstances. ""My conscience would not permit me to be the beneficiary of such a decision.

Student groups and the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) also demonstrated outside the CBSE headquarters in east Delhi's Preet Vihar, raising various demands, including an independent investigation.

Three MPs of DMK, an ally of the Congress, had signed the motion against the Chief Justice on Wednesday, but withdrew on Thursday after advice from the party leadership. Likewise, the Samajwadi Party (SP) had initially appended its signatures but they were later withdrawn.

Special judge M.S.

He said he had written letters to both the prime minister and the finance minister on April 15, 2016 to explain his side of the story. “No response was received from either of them,” Mallya, who is based in London, had said in a statement. “I have been accused by politicians and the media alike of having stolen and run away with Rs 9,000 crores that was loaned to Kingfisher Airlines (KFA). Some of the lending banks have also labelled me a wilful defaulter,” he said. The ED has furnished evidences in its two charge sheets, filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the past, to make a case for seeking a fugitive offender tag for Mallya from the court. Mallya is contesting the money laundering charges in London after India initiated extradition proceedings against the liquor baron to bring him back to the country. Both the ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have filed cases for alleged loan default against him. The Modi government brought the ordinance as “there have been instances of economic offenders fleeing the jurisdiction of Indian courts, anticipating the commencement, or during the pendency, of criminal proceedings”. The ordinance has provisions for special courts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 to declare a person as a fugitive economic offender and order immediate confiscation of assets. “A fugitive economic offender is a person against whom an arrest warrant has been issued in respect of a scheduled offence and who has left India so as to avoid criminal prosecution, or being abroad, refuses to return to India to face criminal prosecution,” the government said. The cases of frauds, cheque dishonour or loan default of over Rs 100 crore would come under the ambit of the ordinance. The measure offers necessary constitutional safeguards in terms of providing hearing to the person through counsel, allowing him time to file a reply, serving notice of summons to him, whether in India or abroad and appeal before a high court.",PTI,PTI
"With the pullout orchestrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the consequent resignation from office by chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, another spell of Governor's Rule seems imminent in the strife-torn state of Jammu and Kashmir. If it comes to this, it would be the eighth time the state will be directly ruled by the Centre. Governor's Rule can be imposed on the state under   if the ""governor is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution. The governor may, by proclamation (a), assume to himself all or any of the functions of the Government of the State and all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by anybody or authority in the State"". Mufti Sayeed's death was the cause for the last promulgation of the Governor's rule on 8 January, 2016 after allies — PDP and BJP — deferred the government formation process till the end of the four-day mourning period. Invoking Section 92 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, Vohra promulgated Governor's rule after approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. It was the seventh time Governor's rule was promulgated in the state since Independence, the first being in March 1977. The central rule came to an end after Mehbooba Mufti was sworn in as the chief minister on 4 April, 2016.  accepted the Centre's recommendation for Governor's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir on 9 January, 2015, that was the sixth time the state went under direct central rule. Governor's Rule was imposed in the state after the Assembly election results on 23 December, 2014, threw up a hung Assembly, with no party or combination of parties able to stake claim to form government and then caretaker chief minister Omar Abdullah asking to be relieved from the duties with immediate effect on 7 January. The PDP had emerged the single largest party with 28 seats in the 87-member House in the staggered elections held over five of the last six weeks of 2014. The BJP came in a close second with 25 seats, followed by the National Conference (15 seats), Congress (12 seats) and others (seven seats). When the BJP and PDP cobbled up an alliance, it was the fourth consecutive time that a democratically elected government in the state was preceded by a spell of Governor's Rule. Sheikh Mohammad was installed as the chief minister of the state following the Indira-Sheikh Delhi Accord in 1975. The tallest leader of the state returned to power with a thumping majority in the subsequent elections held in July 1977. Direct central rule was imposed in Jammu and Kashmir for the second time in March 1986, when the Congress had withdrawn support to the minority government headed by Abdullah's son-in-law Ghulam Mohammad Shah. Shah had engineered a split in the National Conference in 1984 to form his own government with Congress support. However, he had to step down after the Congress withdrew support over law and order problems in the state, leading to the recommendation of Governor's Rule by the then governor Jagmohan Malhotra. The Governor's Rule came to an end in November 1986 after then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi entered into an accord with National Conference President Farooq Abdullah for power-sharing in the state. Jagmohan's return to the Raj Bhavan for the second term in January 1990 led to the resignation of then chief minister Farooq Abdullah, necessitating another spell of Governor's Rule. This was the longest spell of direct central rule in Jammu and Kashmir — six years and eight months — as elections could not be held because militancy had risen in many parts of the state. Although Jagmohan was recalled within six months of his second appointment, the Governor's Rule continued till October 1996 when fresh Assembly elections were held. Governor's Rule had to be imposed in the state for the fourth time in October 2002 after caretaker chief minister Farooq Abdullah refused to continue in office in the wake of his party's defeat in the Assembly elections that year. It was the shortest spell of Governor's Rule — 15 days — as the PDP and Congress, with the support of 12 independents, formed government on 2 November. Governor's Rule was imposed in the state for 174 days after the PDP withdrew support to the Ghulam Nabi Azad-led Congress-PDP coalition government in July 2008. The PDP withdrew support to the government on 28 June, 2008, following widespread protests during the Amarnath land row agitation, which pitted the Hindu-dominated Jammu region against the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley. Azad was to seek a vote of confidence in the Legislative Assembly on 7 July but chose to resign instead. The central rule came to an end on 5 January, 2009, after Omar Abdullah was sworn in as the youngest chief minister of the state.",FP Staff,FP Staff
"Senior BJP leader and former Union minister Sartaj Singh on Thursday, 8 November, switched over to the Congress after his name did not figure in the ruling party's third list for the 28 November Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls. Singh, two-time MLA from Seoni-Malwa who wept openly after the BJP snub, was immediately named as the Congress' nominee for the Hoshangabad Assembly seat in the Opposition party's fifth list, comprising 16 candidates. ""I am grateful to the Congress for nominating me from Hoshangabad. I had been with the saffron family for 58 long years. The BJP denied me a ticket. I want to be in the midst of the people so I am contesting elections,"" Singh told PTI over phone. ""I don't want to sit at home and confine myself to counting prayer beads,"" he added.

Is this trend of nursing personal political ambitions right? If he was such a big leader, why he did not run as an Independent candidate,"" Soumitra said.

Instead of   (retirement in forest), he wants to stay put in   (household).""

A native of Maharashtra, Masani's name figured on the fourth list of 29 candidates released on Wednesday by the Congress.

"Former President Pranab Mukherjee’s friends and detractors didn’t have any doubt about what the country’s most experienced politician would be saying at the RSS gathering at its headquarters in Nagpur on Thursday, 7 June. Yet, most politicians from Bengal were more or less on the same page as Mukherjee’s daughter Sharmistha, a Delhi Congress spokesperson. They felt Mukherjee didn’t have to share the dais with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to iterate what he had said many times in his capacity as a Congress leader, a Union Cabinet minister and also as president of India. There was also a view that Mukherjee didn’t do anything wrong by engaging the RSS chief on a platform that finally championed pluralism of opinions. Bhagwat too admitted plurality of language, religion and view but harped on unity — the oneness of being a son of Bharat.

": Ruling JD(U) on Monday said it attached no importance to ""prejudiced and provocative"" remarks by Union minister Upendra Kushwaha against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The war of words between Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), the two constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), indicates that the notes of discord continued to emanate from within the coalition. The RLSP, which is headed by Kushwaha, hit back saying the JD(U) was jittery over Kumar's declining popularity and the growing appeal of Upendra Kushwaha, especially among the backwards and the Dalits. ""We do not wish to comment on a remark that is prejudiced and provocative. It is well-known that Nitish Kumar has always maintained high standards of public discourse,"" JD(U) state president Vashishtha Narayan Singh told reporters. He was reacting to remarks made by Kushwaha on Sunday wherein Kumar was accused of having called the Union minister   (lowly). At a function organized in Patna on Saturday, the chief minister had said in response to queries about his uneasy relations - in the context of the issue of seat sharing among NDA constituents having become a thorny one, ""please do not lower the level of discourse so much ( )."" Taking affront to the remark, Kushwaha in Muzaffarpur district on Sunday had said, ""I have always called Nitish Kumar my elder brother but he calls me  ."" The RLSP chief also taunted his former mentor for having expressed outrage, three years ago, over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remark that Kumar's political vacillations indicated something is wrong with his DNA. Kushwaha's remarks were also disapproved by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey who said ""the RLSP chief must give a chief minister the respect that is his due. He is himself a Union minister and should avoid indulging in a slanging match."" Maintaining that Kumar's remark was meant to belittle Kushwaha, RLSP national general secretary Madhaw Anand said in a statement ""our leader has always treated Kumar with great respect but the same has never been reciprocated."" ""If he holds such poor opinions about Kushwaha, why did he make the latter the leader of the Opposition in Bihar assembly and sent him to Rajya Sabha later on,"" Anand said. ""Consistency has never been Nitish Kumar's virtue but this time he has hurt the party and shocked the people of Bihar as well,"" he said. ""Kumar is worried about his own falling popularity and jittery over Kushwaha's efforts like the   campaign which has taken the important issue of reservations in the judiciary to the masses, thereby earning him the goodwill of Dalits and OBCs,"" Anand claimed.

"The governments of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada on Sunday rejected Saudi Arabia’s latest explanation for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and said they would wait for the full report from Turkish authorities before deciding how they would deal with Riyadh,   reported.  Riyadh on Saturday admitted after days of denials that dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in Istanbul earlier this month, allegedly after a quarrel and a brawl with unidentified men.  However, in a conflicting report, an unidentified official told   on Sunday that a team of 15 agents had acted without Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s authorisation to kidnap the journalist. He was accidentally choked after resisting and his body was rolled up in a rug and given to a local person for disposal, the official said.  A member of the team then dressed in Khashoggi’s clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate, the official told the news agency. It had taken Riyadh so long to investigate the journalist’s death as the agents had given authorities a false report, the official added. “I do not think it is credible,” the UK’s Brexit Minister Dominic Raab told  . “We support the Turkish investigation and the British government will want to see people held to account for that death.”   He, however, struck a cautious note when asked about imposing sanctions on Riyadh. “We are not going to throw our hands in the air and terminate our relationship with Saudi Arabia, not just because of the huge number of British jobs that depend on it but also because if you exert influence over your partners you need to be able to talk to them,” the minister said. Earlier in the day, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said “full light needs to be shed” on the incident. “I note that the Saudi authorities have changed tack, admitted the facts and accepted some responsibility, so we are making progress,” he added. On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minster Heiko Maas said information provided by the Saudis was insufficient and sought more transparency from Riyadh,   reported. “We expect transparency from Saudi Arabia regarding the circumstances of the death and its background,” the two leaders said in a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry. Merkel said “nothing has been explained so far and we need to explain it”. The European Union’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has described Khashoggi’s death as a “shocking violation” of international conventions, and on Saturday Canada’s Foreign Minister Chrsytia Freeland said “the explanations offered to date lack consistency and credibility”.

He rejected the Congress' claim that there was an undeclared Emergency in the country under the Modi government and said nobody can dare to impose the draconian measure now. Paswan supported the BJP-led NDA government's move to highlight the excesses during the Emergency saying that people should know what had happened then. The Congress slammed the BJP’s attack on the party over the 1975 Emergency. While responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark on Emergency, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the ‘Black Day’ is just a distraction from BJP government failures. “Talking about Emergency 43 years later will not bring ‘ ’ ” he said. ""Delhi Sultanate's 'dictator' Modi, who is even more cruel than Aurangzeb, today gave lessons to the country on the Emergency imposed 43 years ago. By taking out his anger on the Congress, can a lid be put on Modiji's 'jumlas'?"" Surjewala told  . Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma flayed the BJP for drawing a parallel between former prime minister Indira Gandhi and German dictator Adolf Hitler, saying it was an ""absurd and outrageous"" distortion of history. Sharma also said India was now witnessing a systemic subversion of all institutions that ""uphold our Constitution and democracy under the watch of an authoritarian prime minister and arrogant government"". He further said that the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 1975 was an aberration and she herself regretted it. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati said that the country had been under an ""undeclared emergency"" for the last four years and the people were feeling ""suffocated"" due to the prevailing situation. ""The BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi need to introspect on the undeclared emergency-like situation. They should find a solution to problems such as poverty, unemployment and inflation and prove their patriotism,"" Mayawati said. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" BJP MP Varun Gandhi has urged Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to initiate a ""movement"" to encourage economically advantaged Lok Sabha members to forego their remunerations for the remaining term of the Lower House. The move would reinforce people's faith in their representatives, he said. ""A voluntary exercise such as this would send a positive message across the nation regarding the level of sensitivity we possess as elected representatives,"" he wrote in a letter to Mahajan. He also suggested creating an independent, statutory body to ascertain the affordability of the move and the need for an increase in fiscal compensation for MPs. The Sultanpur MP expressed concern over the widening inequality in the country, saying it was ""detrimental"" to democracy. ""India's inequality gap is widening further every day. A growing divide is detrimental to our democracy and we as 
public representatives must be seen to be more responsive to the socio-economic realities of our country,"" the letter read. Gandhi underlined that the move may trouble a few MPs. The remuneration of an MP include a basic salary of Rs 
50,000 per month, Rs 45,000 as constituency allowance, among other allowances. The government spends roughly Rs 2.7 lakh per MP per month, he wrote in the letter. The number of MPs with assets worth over Rs 1 crore rose sharply from 319 in 2009 to 449 at present. Roughly 24 percent or 132 Lok Sabha members have declared assets worth over Rs 10 crore.

"Asserting that BJP's return to power in 2019 is ""not a challenge but a certainty,"" its president Amit Shah on Saturday projected the next Lok Sabha polls as a contest between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to ""remove corruption and poverty"" and the Opposition's single-point agenda of ' '. On the Modi government's fourth anniversary, Shah listed details of its ""successes"" and heaped scorn on the likely challenge from Rahul Gandhi-led Congress, saying he may have declared himself a prime ministerial candidate but his bid has not got support from even his party colleagues, let alone other Opposition leaders. Projecting Modi as the ""most popular and most hardworking prime minister with unending energy,"" Shah said he replaced the UPA's policy paralysis with a policy-driven government working for the poor and improved economy while also raising the country's esteem in the world. Asked about the 'achche din' (good days) promised by the BJP-led ruling alliance when it came to power, Shah said the government has ""done a lot to fulfil its promises in four years and one year is still left. The BJP president came down heavily on the Opposition saying a shocking change has happened in the country's politics with those against the prime minister resorting to lies and speaking it loudly all the time. ""This is something new I am seeing and the Opposition seems to have decided to continue with this tactic till the 2019 polls... Its one-point agenda is 'Modi hatao' (replace Modi) while the BJP and Modi want to remove disorder, corruption and poverty to usher in stability and development,"" Shah said at a press conference. Playing down the challenge from a united Opposition, he said people are standing by Modi like a rock and the prime minister's politics of performance will prevail over those promoting politics of dynasty, casteism and appeasement. Taking on the Congress, which has accused the government of peddling lies and Modi of harming the dignity of his chair, Shah said the BJP is ready for a debate over facts and figures about the Centre's achievements. Countering the charges, the BJP president said the honour of the prime minister's chair had hit rock bottom under the Congress-led UPA, as he took a dig at former prime minister Manmohan Singh, remarking that Modi does not need to seek anybody's permission before taking a decision. Singh was often accused by critics of being guided by the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi in his decisions. ""The Congress will not decide about the dignity of the prime minister's chair. People have done it. They have replaced its 14 state governments (with BJP),"" he said. Asked if he saw a challenge from a united Opposition or Rahul Gandhi in 2019, Shah said there is no challenge and its return to power is a certainty. Referring to Gandhi's comments during the Karnataka Assembly polls that he may be prime minister if his party gets the required numbers, Shah said no Congress leader came out in support of his statement, nor did Opposition leaders like Sharad Pawar, Mamata Banerjee or Akhilesh Yadav. Asked if the government has delivered on its promises, he said it has made successful efforts to change the lives of 22 crore families, referring to welfare schemes like providing LPG cylinder, houses, electricity and toilets among others to the poor, as also efforts to improve the country's economy and security of its borders. Whatever be the Opposition's lies, those who have befitted from the government schemes will remember it, he said, underlining his party's welfare plank. To a question about the Telugu Desam Party leaving the NDA and the saffron party's turbulent relations with another key ally Shiv Sena, Shah said he wants its alliance with Sena to continue and added that 11 new parties, including Nitish Kumar-led JD(U), have joined the ruling bloc. He also discounted the likely challenge from SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh, saying the media had declared the grouping of ""two boys"", a reference to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Gandhi, a winner in the state Assembly poll before the results came, but it was the BJP that swept the election. Shah also said that the BJP's win in 104 seats in Karnataka is a good sign of its expansion in south India. Asked about Pakistan's continued support to terrorism in Kashmir despite Indian Army's operations, including surgical strike, and if war was an option, he said, ""war is the last resort. It is not an option. Maximum number of terrorists have been killed in the last four years."" Shah also said the government is also working on long-term policy to deal with soaring petroleum prices. He claimed that in three years of the UPA rule, petrol and diesel prices were as high as they are now. He also maintained the BJP's position on the Ram temple issue, saying it wants the issue to be resolved either through courts or dialogue. Stating that no village is without power now, Shah said the government recently covered 16800 villages, which had over 50 percent Dalit population, with its seven welfare schemes, Jan Dhan bank account, toilets and LPG cylinder for all homes, and will cover 65000 villages by 15 August. The Modi government ended an era of instability and has delivered on its two key promises, that it will work for the poor, Dalits, tribals, backwards, farmers and village, and that it will raise India's esteem in the world.

" The Supreme Court on Thursday modified the Delhi High Court order by stopping salary and allowances of former Janata Dal (United) president and rebel MP Sharad Yadav till the pendency of his plea challenging his disqualification from the Rajya Sabha. A vacation bench of Justice AK Goel and Justice Ashok Bhushan, however, allowed him to retain his official bungalow, as ordered by the high court on 15 December last year. The apex court's decision came on a plea by JD (U)'s Rajya Sabha MP Ramchandra Prasad Singh challenging the Delhi High Court's interim order which had allowed Yadav to retain his official residence in New Delhi and draw his salary, allowances and perks. The high court, however, had refused to grant interim stay on his disqualification as a Rajya Sabha MP. The interim order of the high court had come on Yadav's plea challenging his disqualification on several grounds, including that he was not given any chance to present his case by the Rajya Sabha chairman before passing an order against him and his colleague and then MP Ali Anwar on 4 December, 2017. On 18 May, the top court had agreed to hear the appeal by Singh and issued a notice to Yadav. Singh had sought the disqualification of Yadav and Anwar on the grounds that they had attended a rally of opposition parties in Patna in violation of the party's directives. Yadav had joined hands with the opposition after JD(U) president and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar dumped the grand alliance with the RJD and the Congress in Bihar and tied up with the BJP in July last year.

": BJP president Amit Shah Tuesday said ""illegal infiltrators"" took away jobs of youths in the country and alleged that Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and other opposition parties had opposed the NRC when 40 lakh such settlers were identified under the exercise. Addressing a convention of BJP workers at Polo Ground in Shivpuri, Shah said the BJP governments would ""drive each and every infiltrator out of the country"" after winning elections in 2018 and 2019. Taking a dig at Gandhi, Shah said he should ""stop daydreaming"" about the Congress coming to power after elections. Referring to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) for Assam, he said the BJP government would drive each of the 40 lakh ""illegal infiltrators"" out of the country as the party stands for national security and rights of Indians. ""When the NRC identified 40 lakh illegal migrants in Assam, Rahul baba and parties like the SP (Samajwadi Party), BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) and Trinmool Congress (TMC) raised a hue and cry and opposed the exercise,"" Shah said. He said the youths of the country lost their jobs to the illegal immigrants. ""These migrants took away the jobs of our youths. They (opposition parties) lacked concern for our youths and for the hunger of the people of this country. We will drive each infiltrator out after winning elections in 2018 and 2019,"" he said. Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in the next two months in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram. While first three of the above states are currently ruled by the BJP, the Congress is in power in the northeastern state. Telangana was ruled by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) before chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao dissolved the assembly. Lok Sabha elections are slated to be held next year. ""Rahul Baba should stop daydreaming. The Congress' condition is that it would (soon) be difficult to find them even with the help of binoculars,"" Shah said. He said the Congress lacked any issues with which it could go to the people seeking votes in the Madhya Pradesh polls. ""How can the Congress succeed in winning polls in Madhya Pradesh? Will you seek votes from people with the help of a 'raja' (former chief minister Digvijaya Singh who is an erstwhile royal), a 'maharaja' (former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia who is a royal descendant) and an industrialist (state Congress chief Kamal Nath) who have never seen poverty?"" he questioned. Shah said Madhya Pradesh became a BIMARU state in the rule of the then chief minister Digvijaya Singh, whereas Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan pulled the state out of poverty and turned it into a developed state. Digvijaya Singh had helmed the state between 1993 to 2003. ""The state budget under the then Congress government was only Rs 20,000 crore, which has gone up to Rs 2 lakh crore. The per capita income has also shot up to Rs 80,000 from Rs 15,000. ""Simultaneously, power generation has also increased from 3000 MW to 18000 MW under the BJP rule. During the time of the Congress, people of the state used to receive power supply for only 3 to 5 hours everyday,"" the BJP chief claimed. Turning to Rahul Gandhi, Shah said the Congress chief had ""insulted"" jawans by asking for evidence of surgical strike conducted by the Army on terrorist launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) in 2016. ""During the Congress regime, Pakistan used to threaten India. Our government taught a lesson to Pakistan through the surgical strike. But Rahul baba was asking for the proof,"" Shah claimed. ""After our government conducted the surgical strike, even mediapersons who used to talk about 'Mauni Baba' (a jibe the BJP uses to attack former PM Manmohan Singh) became silent,"" Shah said. He claimed that before the surgical operation, the US and Israel were the only countries known to avenge death of their soldiers, but the prime minister added India's name to the list. Shah announced that the BJP-led governments across the country would celebrate the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, one of the founder members of the BJP. Before addressing the convention, Shah garlanded statue of Tatya Tope, a general in the 1857 rebellion against the British, at Shivpuri and recalled his contribution. After addressing BJP workers, Shah travelled to Guna, around 90 kms from Shivpuri, where he held a roadshow, after offering prayers at a Hanuman temple.

Akhlaq had succumbed to his injuries on the spot. Of the 18 accused, three were juveniles, who are out on bail. Rana, too, was given bail after spending two and a half years in prison. When questioned about why the Navnirman Sena was choosing to nominate controversial figures for the Lok Sabha elections, Jani said, according to  that his party was fielding Hindu-leaning candidates as it wanted a ""pro-Hindu government"" in India.

"Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that a formidable alliance of Opposition parties can be stitched together to defeat the BJP and free India from the ""reign of fear"" in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Chidambaram, however, avoided directly answering a question on the leadership issue or who would be the prime ministerial candidate of the alliance, saying it is a premature question. ""Let us form the alliance and let the elections take place. All of you want to know the answer even before the script is written,"" he said. The former finance minister said the most important issue on which all Opposition parties agree to is that the saffron party should be defeated. ""On that point, there is a convergence of views in many states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar, etc. That convergence will bring together Opposition parties and alliances will be formed state-wise,"" Chidambaram told   in an interview. He said for the first time, ""we are witnessing a sense of fear"" among a large section of people in the country. ""The Dalits live in fear, the Muslims live in fear, the women live in fear, the press live in fear,"" he said. ""We are moving away from the accepted democratic rights and democratic positions. This is a dangerous trend for the country. We wanted freedom (from British rule) because we want to live without fear. And today, a vast section of the country lives in fear and this has to end,"" Chidambaram said. Asked whether the Congress will replicate the Karnataka model, where despite being the largest party in the Congress-JD(S) alliance it gave away the chief minister's post to JD(S) to keep the BJP at bay, he said it is too early to comment on it. ""Karnataka was a state election. We talked about Karnataka after the election results were announced. Now, the major challenge is the Parliament election and eight months ahead of the polls, we can't talk about what will happen after election. ""There will be alliance in each state depending upon the context of the state... The alliance has to be state-specific. So I think a formidable alliance can be stitched together state-wise for the Parliament elections,"" he said. On reports of certain Opposition parties like the Telangana Rashtra Samiti and the Trinamool Congress not being very comfortable with the Congress leading the front, Chidambaram said it is advisable to wait till the election and the alliance talks to begin. Several Opposition parties including the TMC and the TRS have expressed their reservation about working under the leadership of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, considered as a ""junior politician"". Asked whether the TMC would be part of the Congress-led Opposition alliance, as the Bengal Congress unit is not in favour of it, he said, ""I am not competent to answer that question. But, I am sure when I say that all parties who are opposed to BJP and all who are keen to replace the BJP should come together and form the alliance, that's the position I have stated. Let's see what happens."" About the possibility of formation of such an alliance before the Lok Sabha polls, he said if one or two parties decide to stay away from pre-election alliance, ""I am sure they can join the alliance post the election"". Criticising the Centre on various issues ranging from incidents of lynching to anti-romeo squads, Chidambaram said that people have been either vegetarian or non-vegetarian for hundreds of years, but never ever were they lynched on the suspicion of keeping a particular meat in their house. ""What is happening is serious erosion of democracy, serious erosion of freedom. This has to be stopped in the next Lok Sabha election,"" he said. The senior Congress leader said that the Narendra Modi government was trying to undermine the success in delivering a better economic growth during the UPA 1 and 2 regime. ""You can't hide the numbers. The numbers speak for themselves. This is desperation of the Modi government to project itself as better than the UPA government.

"Accusing the BJP of acting ""power hungry"" in Goa, the Congress on Saturday, 13 October, demanded that Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar step down and it be allowed to prove majority, by convening a special session of the state assembly. Congress leaders Pawan Khera and Goa PCC Chief Girish Chodankar, claimed that the BJP is not removing Parrikar from the Chief Minister’s post, fearing that he might “spill the beans” on the Rafale fighter jet deal. The opposition party also accused the BJP of ""betraying"" the people of Goa and ""killing governance"" in the state. The opposition party alleged that the BJP ""usurped"" power in Goa through backdoor. ""People of Goa had given the mandate to the Congress. Governor Mridula Sinha should listen to the voice of people of Goa and opposition parties and allow us to prove our numbers on the floor of the House,” Chodankar said. He claimed of a Congress majority in Goa and added, “Goans deserve a full time chief minister and to ensure democracy and constitutional functioning, a floor test is imperative"". At the same time, he added “no constitutional morality can be expected from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, because they are drunk with power”. Replying to a query, he said as the Defence Minister, Parrikar must have had a lot of information on the Rafale deal. ""So we have no doubt that the moment the Prime Minister and the BJP President pressure him or demand his resignation or they try to remove him, Manohar Parrikar will not keep quiet, he will reveal all the secret information, important information, which can expose our Prime Minister,"" he claimed. Khera said the Congress has demanded that the Goa Governor convene a one-day special session, so that it can ask the government to prove majority. Wishing Parrikar a speedy recovery and long life, he said his ailment cannot be an impediment to the aspirations of the people of Goa, as people of the state want governance, administration and progress. ""Instead of taking Cabinet meetings in AIIMS Delhi, Parrikar should show moral righteousness and voluntarily step down from his post, and get ready for a floor test,"" he said. Khera alleged that the ""state is headless, governance is paralyzed, administration is crippled, there is complete breakdown of authority, rule of law has collapsed, people are feeling cheated with absolutely no policy and direction and Goa is in chaos"". Parrikar, who is undergoing treatment for a pancreatic ailment in New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), held meetings with party leaders as well as allies on Friday, 12 October, to discuss ways to ensure that his government functions normally. He is expected to shed ""many"" of his portfolios after Dussehra, according to ministers who met him. But Khere said, ""This desperate drama of holding a cabinet meeting in AIIMS and playing musical chairs with the portfolio of ministers is the last straw and is akin to rubbing salt on wounds of people of Goa."" In the 40-member state assembly, the Parrikar government has the support of 23 MLAs. These comprise 14 BJP MLAs, three each from the Goa Forward Party and MGP as well as three Independents.

" The Congress on Wednesday accused the Narendra Modi government of ""backstabbing"" honest tax payers by lowering the interest rate on EPF. The party also alleged that it the government was indulging in ""organised fleecing"" and ""legalised pilferage"". Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said that the prime minister had promised to bring ' ' (good days), but in the last four years, his actions have only brought ' ' (bad days) to the people of the country. ""Post the colossal loss of almost Rs 30,000 crore 'loot' and scams being unravelled in the past seven days, the Modi government has once again backstabbed the common people and honest tax payers of the country by reducing the interest rates on EPF from 8.65 percent to 8.55 percent,"" he said. The Congress leader claimed that post 2014-15, this was the second such reduction and interest rate on EPF has now been reduced twice from 8.75 percent (in 2014-15) now to just 8.55 percent. Earlier in December 2017, he said the Centre had cut the interest rate on small savings schemes, including the Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and KisanVikas Patra, by 0.2 percentage points for the January-March quarter. ""Since Modi came to power in 2014, his government has indulged in a systematic reduction of interest rates which have extinguished the savings of crores of common people,"" he said. Surjewala said in a statement that the interest rate for savings bank account which was 4 percent in May 2014 was now 3.5 percent. He claimed that by reducing 0.5 pc interest rate, the depositors of State Bank of India, India's largest public sector bank, have to face a cut of Rs 4,700 crore per year in their hard earned savings. Surjewala said interest rate for saving in PPF has been reduced from 8.7 percent (in May 2014, during the Congress-UPA) to just 7.6 percent effective from January. This has adversely affected nine crore such depositors, he claimed. ""Modi had promised 'Achhe Din', but in the last four years, his actions have only resulted in 'Bure Din' for India's people. Only one year is left now, and people of India are surely readying to give a resounding answer to Modi government's anti-people policies,"" he said.

" Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel has moved the Supreme Court seeking dismissal of a petition in the Gujarat High Court challenging his election to the Rajya Sabha in 2017. Patel was elected to the Rajya Sabha last year after beating the BJP nominee Balwantsinh Rajput, who had resigned from the Congress party to join the BJP. The win for the Congress leader came after the Election Commission cancelled the votes of two Congress MLAs Bhola Bhai Gohil and Raghav Bhai Patel which brought down the requirement for an outright victory for a candidate to 44 from 45. Immediately after Patel got elected, Rajput filed a petition in the HC challenging the Election Commission's decision to invalidate votes of the two rebel MLAs. Had these votes been counted, he would have defeated Patel, Rajput said. His petition had also alleged that Patel took party MLAs to a resort in Bengaluru before the election, which amounted to bribing the voters. Patel had challenged Rajput's plea and sought its dismissal at the ""threshold level"" for not serving on respondents an attested copy of the petition as required under the law. The high court, however, rejected his plea and said the petitioner has substantially complied with the provisions of law and the defects could be easily cured. Patel has now moved the top court against the high court order saying that Rajput's petition was ""devoid of merits"" and fails to show any ""cause of action"".",PTI,PTI

"Even as the police of Bihar’s Darbhanga district and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi claimed the an aged man was beheaded due to an old land dispute, a team of BJP leaders who visited the village to probe the incident confirmed that the murder happened because he had named a site there after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Union Minister Giriraj Singh, Bihar BJP president and MP Nityanand Rai and MLA Sanjay Sarawgi visited Bhadwa village where the incident took place,   reported. ""The dispute that escalated (and led to the murder) had started due to this chowk being named Modi Chowk,""  quoted Nityanand Rai as saying. However, on 16 March, Sushil Kumar Modi had claimed on Twitter that the murder was the result of a land dispute. Tejashwi Yadav, the leader of Opposition in Bihar, criticised the BJP for “communalising” society. He claimed that this was simply the BJP’s “tactic” to hide their loss in Araria constituency, in the recently concluded by polls.

Last month, he had claimed that with Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar remaining indisposed since 15 February, the state is in complete crisis and the administration is on the verge of collapse.

Last month, he had said that they cannot ignore the fact that the coalition government is ""not in a position"" to run the state in absence of Parrikar and due to this situation, decision on important issues, like the crisis in the mining sector, was put on hold. Parrikar had left Goa for Mumbai in the first week of March. He later went to the USA for further treatment of a pancreatic ailment.

" Continuing its tirade against Maharashtra Tourism Minister Jaykumar Rawal, the NCP on Wednesday raised the charge of a ""conflict of interest"" against the BJP leader vis-a-vis a hill resort in Nandurbar. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged that Rawal's company Toranmal Hill Resorts Private Ltd was operating the resort in Nandurbar district in north Maharashtra despite the company being blacklisted by the state-run tourism development corporation (MTDC). ""From 1998 to 2006, Rawal's company Toranmal Hill Resorts Private Ltd. was given an MTDC resort on lease. The company did not pay the lease rent to the MTDC, which in turn invoked provisions of the Eviction of Public Premises Act, in 2011 and sent a notice to the company. ""However, MTDC officials were not allowed to do their work and were forcibly turned away,"" Malik alleged while addressing a press conference here. The NCP leader claimed that the Toranmal Hill Resorts Pvt Ltd is among the two lakh companies that were blacklisted by the Registrar of Companies after demonetisation. He said the company was deregistered in June last year. ""However, the company purchased five-acre land in Dondaicha (in Dhule district) last year. As per land records, the company belongs to Jaykumar Rawal. This is a conflict of interest as Rawal is chairman of the MTDC in his capacity as Tourism Minister,"" Malik said. He alleged that the company continues to function even after it was blacklisted and the hill resort is still accepting bookings. Malik said the competent authorities of the MTDC had issued an eviction notice against the resort which has not been stayed. ""Rawal's company kept the issue alive in court claiming that it had spent Rs 60 lakh on repairs of the resort while denying to pay the rent,"" he alleged.

Good evening to all of you today. Thank you very much Ms Sevanti Ninan and the Media Foundation for inviting me to be the speaker at this year’s BG Verghese memorial lecture. Greetings also to Mr Stephen Butler, Mr Chaitanya Kalbag, and other distinguished members of the audience. I knew of BG Verghese from the days when he was the Chairperson of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. I was on the executive committee of CHRI, and he was a wonderful person to work with. 2. BG Verghese was a pillar of strength, in more ways than one for journalists, human rights activists and civil society in general. He stood by and fought for democratic principles throughout, alongside other stalwarts like Jayaprakash Narayan, and VM Tarkunde. Most notably, I remember that, during emergency, his criticism of government policy led him to be removed from his role as editor of the Hindustan Times. 3. Verghese stood for a great many things, which showed through all his actions and work - whether it was working for civil liberties and democratic rights, through his association with organisations like CHRI, PUCL and the like, or the idea of a free press, through symbolising what was meant by ideal journalism. Indeed, journalism was practically his mission. It goes without saying that he is greatly missed today, especially in this age when large sections of media have become propaganda machines, more than anything else. 4. When I was asked to speak at this memorial lecture, I thought it would be most appropriate, and relevant, to speak of the proceedings that have lately besieged the institution I have been most closely associated with, the judiciary. 1. I want to start with a small anecdote. In the late 19th century, the third Chief Justice of Victoria in Australia was one George Higinbotham, whose reputation as someone who was extremely thrifty, and who derided wealth was only too well known. His fees when practising as a lawyer were notoriously low, and he routinely distributed his earnings to the needy. One story of his when he was judge particularly stands out. As Chief Justice, he was entitled to a stipend of 3500 Pounds, which was 500 pounds more than his fellow judges. He was so uncomfortable at the prospect of being paid that extra amount, that he would spend the additional 500 pounds on lavish entertainments, which were completely useless to him. His view was that as Chief Justice, he was merely  , or first among equals. In his official capacity, he was the chairperson and official representative of the bench, but in all respects, he regarded his powers to be identical to those of his fellow judges. 2. Indeed, this is true of anywhere in the world, that is, a Chief Justice is merely first among equals. Even in High Courts in India, which I am familiar with, even though a Chief Justice has certain official roles, such as showing some intellectual leadership, presiding over administrative meetings, and allocating work, and recommending names of judges for elevation, along with the collegium of judges, at no point in time is the Chief Justice considered or made to believe that they may be superior to other judges in the court. 3. Another Australian judge, Sir Owen Dixon, captured this idea beautifully, in his speech on being sworn into the office of Chief Justice: 1. There is no need for me to be cryptic about why I choose to speak on this subject. All of you are well aware of what it is that I am referring to. But it is worth recapturing just briefly, if only to re-emphasise the importance and gravity of the incident, which I worry that perhaps we have not fully grasped. 2. A little less than 2 months ago, on January 12, 2018, tremors shook the ground beneath the Indian judicial system, “in an extraordinary event in the history of any nation”, as the protagonists themselves described it, when four of the five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court decided to go public with their concerns about the working of the institution they were a part of. Never before in the history of independent India, and certainly not in the history of the highest court of the land, had judges addressed the media through a press conference. The four judges - Justices Jasti Chelameshwar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph -- without mincing words, said that unless the judiciary as an institution is preserved, “democracy will not survive” in this country. 3. Their concerns spanned a range of issues, but most importantly, included the administration of the Supreme Court, which, they said, is not in order, and I quote, “many things which are less than desirable have happened in the last few months”. They also expressed pointed displeasure at the Chief Justice of India’s actions over the past few months, stating that “We met the CJI with a specific request which unfortunately couldn't convince him that we were right therefore, we were left with no choice except to communicate it to the nation that please take care of the institution.” and that “We tried collectively to persuade the Chief Justice of India that certain things are not right and remedial measures need to be taken, but unfortunately we failed”, which is why they decided to approach the press and make their concerns public. 4. The crux of their allegation was that court conventions of bench-strength and bench-composition, in the allocation of cases, were not being followed. They specifically alleged that, “there have been instances where cases having far-reaching consequences for the nation and the institution had been assigned by the Chief Justices of this Court selectively to the benches ‘of their preferences’ without any rational basis for such assignment.” 5. The judiciary in India is unarguably an institution that enjoys the trust of the people. It is perhaps one of the most powerful institutions in the country, and is highly regarded for having upheld constitutional principles time and again over the past decades. 6. This press conference and the allegations made by the judges brought to light many issues which have been simmering for several months, and which strike at the foundations of the institution. Today, I want to talk about these issues, the implications it has on the future of the judiciary, and the kinds of questions we need to be asking to ensure that our democratic system remains in good health. 1. When the four judges held this press conference, some commentators speculated that this amounted to gross impropriety on their part, and their actions smacked of judicial misconduct. While they have not attempted to defend their actions thereafter, it seems unlikely that they would not have assessed the implications of these events. Indeed, their actions actually suggest the contrary, that rather than being in breach of their code of conduct, they were perhaps displaying allegiance to the oath of office they took upon entering office. 2. I believe that these four judges felt so troubled by the goings on in the judiciary and the Supreme Court in particular over the past few months that they felt driven to go public, for otherwise, they would be in transgression of their constitutional duties. In my mind there was no doubt as to the intentions behind the press conference. All four of the judges involved risked something or the other in being a part of this public conference. Justice Gogoi, for example, has placed on the line his chances of succeeding Justice Dipak Misra as the Chief Justice of India (CJI), for, as per, convention, the incoming CJI is appointed on the recommendation of the outgoing CJI. In equal measure, the other three, although they will retire well before the current CJI does, have risked criticism from their peers, and perhaps also getting isolated from the bar and bench after they retire. 1. When the press conference took place, the question that probably crossed most people’s minds was whether the judges were right - in the first place - to speak publicly at all. 2. This reminds me of an incident that took place when I was a judge in the Bombay High Court. Around then, some serious allegations had been made against the then Chief Justice in Bombay High Court. In this case, the senior judges took the lead against the Chief Justice. They spoke to the Bar privately, and they also involved some junior judges, and took them into their confidence. Eventually, the Chief Justice was made to resign by the Supreme Court. If the senior judges had not been received in this manner, or if the resignation had not taken place, I have often wondered what might have happened. The senior judges might well have gone to the press, had they been sufficiently disenchanted with the way things were. There are situations and situations that lead individuals to take action. 3. In this regard, Justice MC Chagla, who, in my opinion, was one of India’s finest Judges, had some apposite remarks to make in his autobiography. In the case of Justice MC Chagla, in contrast to the story I just told you, however the pressure came from the government. The then Chief Minister of Bombay, Morarji Desai, had expressed disapproval at certain speeches Justice Chagla had made criticising government and policy. Justice Chagla, while agreeing with the Chief Minister Desai, that a judge should not take part in politics or discuss political issues, said that this rule was subject to two exceptions: the first was the right to criticise the government on its education policy, which he was personally interested in, but the second was the more important one, relating to laws which concerned the administration of justice. Justice Chagla said that “if the government passed any law or pursued any policy which … undermined the prestige of the judiciary or weakened the administration of justice,” he would “speak, and speak out loudly”. 4. While this is clearly not a situation like Justice Chagla found himself in, the issue raised by the four judges concerns the question of administration of justice, and to that extent, I think many of us would agree that it behoves a member of the judiciary to “speak out loudly”. 5. In his book unambiguously titled  , the English baronet and barrister, David Pannick, captures this appropriately in his critical analysis of the Kilmuir Rules, set out in 1955 in the UK which prohibit judges from participation on radio and television. Fortunately, this rule is no longer the norm in the UK. But it came about when the BBC asked Lord Chancellor Kilmuir to grant permission to certain judges to participate in a series of radio lectures about great judges of the past. In response, Kilmuir said that “the importance of keeping the judiciary in this country insulated from the controversies of the day” was of primary concern. Kilmuir added that it was inappropriate for judges to be associated with “anything which could be fairly interpreted as entertainment”, including talks, and that, as a general rule, it was “undesirable” for judges to appear on radio or television. 6. Pannick correctly argues that this ban had no justification, especially in the case of an independent judiciary. He says,     7. Especially in circumstances that are considered damaging to the administration of justice, the silence of judges cannot possibly be justifiable. Pannick adds that,  8. Closer to home, Justice MC Chagla, too, was only too aware of the consequences of silence. In his autobiography, he wrote  9. “It is an unfortunate fact”, he added, “that all governments, regardless of their complexion, resent criticism, opposition and dissent to a greater or lesser degree.” Arguably, this fear persists even today, but such fear should not overwhelm the freedom to speak out. 1. Several judges and lawyers expressed the view that these four should not have gone public, but should have attempted to resolve the matter internally. As one English Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, said that”the best judge [is] the man who [is] least known to the readers of the Daily Mail”, and who advised that “judges should not court publicity and certainly should not do their work in such a way as to to ‘catch the eye of the newsman’”. 2. Some observers said that these four judges violated judicial ethics in going to the public in this fashion. On May 7, 1997, the Supreme Court of India in its Full Court adopted a Charter called the “Restatement of Values of Judicial Life” to serve as a guide to be observed by Judges, essential for independent, strong and respected judiciary, indispensable in the impartial administration of justice. According to guideline number 8,   Guideline number 9 says that   3. But in the present context, neither of these guidelines - 8 or 9 - can be held up against the actions of the four judges. Did they enter into public debate? On the contrary, they made only a public disclosure. They did not express views on political matters, or on matters pending for judicial determination. Instead, they made a public statement on what they felt was the state of the institution they were a part of, about judicial independence and impartiality, about administrative functioning, case allocation, and judicial convention. 4. One worthy judge-commentator also said that there must be contempt action against these four judges. Suggestions such as this merely perpetuate the cultural norms of secrecy and non-transparency that have led the judiciary to where it is today - as an opaque institution that can neither be questioned from within or outside. This institutional construct is a legacy of our colonial past, and no longer holds valid in the context of modern notions of governance, administration, transparency and accountability. 5. Several sections of the media have reported that many principles and conventions regarding allocation of cases were disregarded. Some reports suggest that cases that were only part-heard by one bench were abruptly shifted to another bench. 6. In the circumstances, what were the alternatives for the four judges They already spoke to the Chief Justice directly, but to no avail. The letter detailing their concerns which they disclosed after the press conference, had been sent to the Chief Justice, in November 2017, a few months before they called this conference. Clearly, these issues were brewing for a long time. They could have gone to the other judges within the Court, but surely, it would have created a greater rift. They could have, as a last resort, gone to the President of India, but I am relieved that they did not, for at any and all costs, the independence of the institution must always be maintained, and the executive and legislature should be kept out of judicial affairs. 1. Although they did not say it in so many words, it was clear that the immediate trigger for the press conference was a meeting held with the Chief Justice earlier that day, regarding the allocation of one particular case - involving a deceased judge of a special CBI court, Judge BH Loya - to a particular bench. 2. Judge Loya was presiding over the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, and died of a heart attack in December 2014 in Nagpur. While the Sheikh case is a complex and convoluted matter in itself, Judge Loya’s death and the case filed thereafter is backed by its own set of conspiracy theorists. Was there an attempt to pressurise the judge in making a decision in the Sheikh case? Was he offered bribes? Was it the court’s duty to inquire into his death? And so on. Many unanswered questions exist, and while it is a digression likely to be of much interest, I need to return to focus on the issue I began with, that is, the immediate trigger for the press conference. 3. According to the four judges, they were concerned about the bench to which this case was allocated to, which was contrary to roster and convention. 4. After the press conference, the Chief Justice made public the roster for the Supreme Court. On the face of it, it is a step towards transparency. But on closer observation, a few concerns emerge. For example, he has kept all the PILs to himself, except social justice. As a result, all PILs, the appeals/SLPs against orders passed by High Courts in PILs will also go to the CJI, or the CJI will allot it to a bench of his choice. That is the essence of the roster which has been declared. More importantly, all accountability matters have all been kept with the CJI. 5. In the present scenario, in the roster made public, we see that all four judges who made this public declaration are kept out of all important matters, be it the Ayodhya case, the Aadhaar matter, or the land acquisition row. While it is true that seniority is not the sole criterion, but seniority does matter. From my experience, for example, whenever a new judge comes in the court, they remain quiet, at least for a while. Even when sitting in hearing, they mostly tend to agree with the senior judge who is with them on the bench. The expectation of both the senior and the junior judge is that the senior judge at least would have been there for a few years, and would have some experience. The junior judge would bring a complementary perspective of new views. The implicit understanding is that experience matters. This is how you get plurality of views in decision making. 1. Throughout the world, judiciaries in other countries have evolved principles of neutral case assignment, and fairness, transparency and accountability in judicial procedure to strengthen their judicial institutions. India can only learn from these things. 2. What is neutral case assignment, you may ask? As Professor Petra Butler describes it,it is a system designed to prevent the risk of judicial panels being packed, or to prevent the risk associated with the perception that panel packing may have occurred or may take place in the future. It involves making decisions for assignment based on principles of neutrality, impartiality, transparency and collegiality or consultation. Why is neutral case assignment important? She gives four reasons, which are useful to replicate - first, courts are protected from intervention in the quest for justice. Second, it bolsters public confidence in the impartiality and independence of the judiciary. Third, it assures litigants of equality and fairness, in that everyone has the same chance of getting a judge favourable or unfavourable to their cause. And fourth, it ensures that basic rights and freedoms are not compromised. 3. Of these, the importance of establishing and retaining public confidence is often misunderstood or miscalculated. In the 2002 US case of Grutter v. Bollinger, one issue was whether the panel the judges were sitting on had been packed. The dissenting judge made the acute observation that “unless we expose to public view our failures to follow the court’s established procedures, our claim to legitimacy is illegitimate”. It would be heartening to see our judiciary pay equal importance to these questions. 4. In the United Kingdom, the practice of case assignment has developed through custom and convention, with a very strong emphasis on a “culture of trust”. This culture of trust is so strong within the judiciary, that the values of impartiality and internal judicial independence appear to have been internalised. The process of allocation of cases has some structure, but also allows for discretion. The Registrar assigns cases to panels on a random basis. But the ultimate authority lies with the President and Deputy President of the court. These two, however, do not act as if they have unlimited discretion, and they use a consultative, flexible and open approach to case allocation - the operative word here, in my opinion, being consultative. As a result, it has become a matter of convention that other judges in the court are consulted and provide feedback on the constitution of panels. 5. This is further accentuated by the conventions evolved around bias, and perceptions of bias. The general principle is that wherever a fair minded and impartial observer would consider there to be a real possibility of bias, the judge concerned must recuse, as concluded in Porter v. Magill. Further, if there is a real ground for doubt in any case, that doubt should be resolved in favour of recusal. 6. This notion of convention dictating judicial practice in matters of assignment is followed in other commonwealth countries as well, such as Australia and Canada but with stricter norms governing convention. 7. For example, in the High Court of Australia, the Chief Justice “proposes” a roster for each sitting. The power of assignment exercised by the Chief Justice is not determinative in any way, but merely recommendatory. It also relies on convention, and like the UK principle, a judge is disqualified if a reasonable person may suspect that the judge might be unable to bring a completely impartial mind to bear on the subject of the litigation. 8. In the United States Courts of Appeal, case assignments are random, and are separated from panel selection, to maintain integrity in the process. The US Supreme Court itself sits en banc and is not, therefore, a suitable comparator, here. 9. An alternative to convention dictating norms of case assignment is to have clearly defined rules, as is the case in Europe. The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has its Rules of the Court that set out how cases are to be allocated. Seniority and rotation or drawing of lots is the usual process. This process recognises that seniority bestows certain rights. At the same time, the rules offer a neutral filter, because they create clear and accountable methods that spread the workload and minimise arbitrariness. The ECHR’s Grand Chamber, for example, as per the relevant rule 24(1), will comprise the President, the Vice Presidents, Section Presidents, and eleven other judges and substitute judges chosen by drawing lots. 10. The European Court of Justice also has elaborate rules, in similar fashion. Benches follow the principle of seniority, with the President, Vice President and Chamber President automatically included, and other members chosen either according to simple seniority, or the principle of “seniority alternating in reverse order” (in other words, the first on the list is the senior most, the second on the list is the junior most, and so on). 11. It is clear that clear rules and convention are followed everywhere in administrative matters involving the court. These are scrupulously observed in order to preserve the integrity of the judiciary as an independent and fair institution. An environment of trust envelops the entire process. 12. In contrast, having, or claiming to have, unbridled power as master of the roster can be a dangerous thing. Take for example, a report prepared by a delegation of the International Bar Association, on judicial independence in Russia. The delegation noted that,   in that country. Further, the delegation said that there was anecdotal evidence to suggest that particular cases were allocated by the Chief Justice to judges more likely to deliver “desired” verdicts, or that cases were transferred in the middle of proceedings because the judge concerned refused to be influenced. 1.

Further, the delegation said that there was anecdotal evidence to suggest that particular cases were allocated by the Chief Justice to judges more likely to deliver “desired” verdicts, or that cases were transferred in the middle of proceedings because the judge concerned refused to be influenced. 1. The question that arises in the present context is whether this power of being “master of the roster” is unfettered and can be exercised without due attention being paid to convention or transparency and fairness. 2. I would like to stress that I am not - in any way - suggesting that seniority should have been the criteria for allocation of cases, but the fact that all four of the top five judges of the Supreme Court, other than the Chief Justice, have been curiously kept out of all constitutional matters, is surely strange and something to be questioned. 3. Surely it is the duty of every Chief Justice to aspire to protect fundamental features of the judiciary. There are robust practices that are followed in many High Courts in India itself, which can be used as examples. For example, Chief Justices of High Courts normally decide benches in advance, taking into conscious consideration relevant factors such as the ability of the judges and their previous experience in handling certain kinds of subject matters. Division Benches are always headed by senior judges, and it will never happen that a senior judge is sitting in a roster of lower importance, while a junior judge heads a Division Bench. The objective of the Chief Justice, in managing the roster, is to strike a balance between disposal of cases, and maintaining the integrity and independence of the institution and the quality of justice that is meted out. 4. What is to happen when a Chief Justice does not adhere to these principles? Does being “master of the roster” mean that such a person remains unaccountable and cannot be questioned? 5. The present Chief Justice’s actions may have been exercised in individual capacity, but are indicative of a deeper malaise affecting the Indian judiciary. Any educated observer will have noticed that the Supreme Court has, to use Shekhar Gupta’s phrase, “ring-fenced, if not quarantined itself”.. This opacity has not developed by circumstance, but is a pro-active construct of the judiciary itself, reaching its apogee, perhaps, in denying the application of the Right to Information Act to itself. For many decades, the judiciary has hidden behind a mask of constitutionalism, defending its silence as an intrinsic feature of the its institutional integrity and role as a constitutional authority. But such a display of silence and integrity comes up short when it is at the cost of the rule of law, and principles of transparency and accountability. 6. There is little that outsiders can do to persuade this arm of State to open up. Ultimately, the desire to be transparent and follow principles of rule of law and natural justice must emerge from within the institution itself. That is what has happened with this press conference. 7. The most immediate - and most appropriately positioned - constituency to question the judiciary’s behaviour over the past few decades is the Bar. The leaders of the Bar ought take more proactive steps towards pushing for reforms in the judiciary, especially in introducing transparency, in asking the judiciary to open up about allocation of work. They can play a much greater role than they have played to date. 1. I believe the Indian judiciary has much to learn from many places - from other courts of the world, or even from within the Indian judicial system itself. Whether it is developing a strong culture of trust and consultation like the English, or building a clear, transparent, seniority- and rules-based system of allocation like the Europeans, or avoiding the ad hoc-ism of Russia, we have a lot to learn and adopt and evolve for ourselves. 2. Similarly, we need to introspect and reflect on what our own judicial system has evolved into. 3. In a system that is built on the idea of the separation of powers, each branch of the state feels that it operates in perfect internal balance. Indeed, in India, the threat to judicial independence is most commonly seen as one emerging from the executive branch, and occasionally the legislature. Today, we have a situation which was foreseen many decades ago, by Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud, when in 1985 he observed, “There is greater threat to the independence of the judiciary from within than without...” Mind well, these threats many a times are orchestrated at the behest of the executive. 4. Do not mistake all that I have said over this past hour or so as mere criticism. Instead, you must realise that I am pointing to an opportunity that lies ahead for the judiciary. If anything must happen as a consequence of this unfortunate incident, it is reform. The judiciary needs immediate reform on multiple fronts. Why, for instance, is the issue of applicability of RTI to the CJI still pending for the last 10 years after the decision of the Delhi High Court? And surely, the time has come to do away with the collegium system, and relook at the opaque system that the judges have constructed for themselves. And most certainly, this is an opportunity to introduce reform in the allocation of cases. The role played by the CJI as master of the roster should be more consultative process than it is today. Perhaps the Supreme Court can consider framing rules along the lines of the ECJ and ECHR. A healthy balance of senior and junior judges is also desirable, as I discussed earlier. There must also be efforts made to democratize the position of the CJI and High Court Chief Justices. They all enjoy immense powers in the courts, as their roles are structured today. It would be wonderful if the present CJI would take up these issues. In any case, Justice Gogoi has raised some of these questions, and if he is indeed next in line to the office of CJI, he must use his time to change these processes. 5. India has been fortunate to count amongst its public intellectuals, women and men who have been fine lawyers and judges, who understand and appreciate the many facets and nuances of judicial independence, transparency and fairness. In their hands, I know that the judiciary will not be allowed to implode or compromise on its integrity. In the hands of a probing and critical fourth estate, I know that the judiciary will be compelled to stand up and play its role as the upholder of constitutional values to its fullest and truest standard. In the hands of the people of India, I know that the judiciary will remain the most important and trustworthy institution this country has known in its modern history. Now, all I can ask you all to do is to live up to your respective roles with complete and utter sincerity. Thank you.. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

" A senior government bureaucrat alleged “racial discrimination” and “rude behaviour” by the British Airways, which offloaded him and his family from a flight last month because his three-year-old son was crying, prompting Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu to seek a detailed report into the incident. The family was travelling on the BA flight to Berlin from London on July 23 when the incident reportedly took place. “I have directed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to obtain a detailed report from British Airways on the issue,” the Minister tweeted. The DGCA is the aviation watchdog in the country. The bureaucrat, in a letter to Prabhu on August 3, alleged that another Indian family, sitting behind them, was also offloaded as they offered biscuits to the child to console him. The bureaucrat alleged that the crew got the plane (BA 8495) to return to the tarmac, where the security personnel took their boarding passes away. The customer care service manager did not give reasons for offloading them nor did the management take action against the crew despite lodging a complaint, he claimed. “We had to make our own arrangements for staying and travelling to Berlin the next day by paying a very hefty amount,” he said, adding that the other Indian family was given tickets for a flight the next day, although no accommodation was given. The bureaucrat is a joint secretary-level officer in the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. Asked about the issue, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, “We will have to see at what level and in what circumstances this has to be taken up.” When contacted, a British Airways spokesperson said, “We take such claims very seriously and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We have started a full investigation and are in contact with the customer.” The spokesperson later said, “It is a safety requirement for all airlines that passengers are seated and have their seat belt fastened for take-off.” Narrating his family’s ordeal in the two-page letter to Prabhu, the officer demanded a thorough investigation and strictest possible action against the British Airways staff. He said while his wife managed to calm their son, an “aggrieved” crew member approached them and started scolding the boy, asking him to get back to his seat. The boy had a window seat, but the mother had taken him into her arms to console him. “With this unusual behaviour of the male crew member, my son got terrified and started crying intensively. My wife again put the boy on his designated seat and fastened the seat-belt, even though he kept on crying intensively being in a terrified state of mind due to the scolding by the male crew member,” the officer wrote. He alleged that when the plane started moving towards the runway, the crew member came back, shouting, “You bloody keep quiet, otherwise you would be thrown out of the window.”",PTI,PTI
"Senior advocate Yatin Oza, a former BJP MLA, has written a controversial open letter in support of Justices Chelameswar, Gogoi, Lokur and Kurian Joseph, arguing that their recent actions were justified in light of serious allegations against CJI Dipak Misra. It should be noted that the judges have not endorsed or approved of Oza’s actions. The 5-page letter, which can be accessed  , begins by referencing a special committee set up by former CJI TS Thakur in 2016 to conduct a probe into allegations against two judges of the Orissa High Court. Oza contends that the report of this committee, submitted in July 2017 to then-CJI JS Khehar, found the two High Court judges innocent but recommended the setting up of a further committee to look into allegations of grave and serious acts of corruption against Justice Dipak Misra. It should be noted that this report is not available in the public domain, and that Oza’s contentions cannot be confirmed or denied as a result. Oza then goes on to allege that the former CJI had been under pressure ever since reports emerged that seemed to indicate wrongdoing by his son. He claims that the government pressurised Justice Khehar to reject the committee’s recommendation to investigate Justice Misra, which allowed the latter to take office as CJI after Justice Khehar’s retirement. The senior advocate at the Gujarat High Court also alleges that there were meetings between Justice Misra and Amit Shah – which he has based on hearsay and “gossip” among lawyers of the Supreme Court. The letter then makes more allegations against the current CJI, which go beyond the assignment of important cases only to courts 8 and 10 of the Supreme Court (the latter is headed by Justice Arun Mishra, and had originally been assigned to hear the Judge Loya petitions) – again, it should be noted that no evidence is offered for these. He further writes that the four senior judges who held the press conference and wrote a public letter criticising the functioning of the Supreme Court had no personal issues against CJI Misra, and that they had actually acted in the interests of the country. He concludes the letter by criticising sections of the media, as well as the media cells of a certain political party for their aggressive campaign to “defame” the four judges, and alleges that this is part of a coordinated plan by that political party. He urges everyone to stand by the four senior judges, as not doing so risks the “existence, dignity and independence” of the Supreme Court. It should be noted that none of the four judges have endorsed these views and they are entirely unsolicited. In a postscript, Oza also mentions that he will soon provide more details of the circumstances behind the death of CBI Special Judge BH Loya in 2014. This will allegedly include details on the actions of former Bombay High Court Chief Justice Mohit Shah, and the transfer of the judge who was originally supposed to be hearing Amit Shah’s discharge application (presumably in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case). Again, he does not indicate what his sources for this information are. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",The Quint,The Quint
" Actor Kamal Haasan today alleged that money power was behind TTV Dhinakaran's win in the 21 December RK Nagar bypoll, drawing sharp rebuke from the sidelined AIADMK leader who accused the star of maligning voters. In a stinging article as part of his weekly series in the latest issue of Tamil magazine  , the veteran star described the bypoll, held due to the demise of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, as a ""stain"" on Indian democracy. Responding to Haasan's salvo, Dhinakaran hit back saying the actor was making such allegations as he could not digest his win in the bypoll. Amidst accusations of money distribution by rival sides—the AIADMK and the Dhinakaran camp—the former Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MP, contesting as an independent, had trounced the ruling party candidate E Madhusudhanan. He won by a margin of 40,000 votes, giving a jolt to the Chief Minister K Palaniswamy led dispensation. Both Dhinakaran, as well as the ruling party, have denied charges of money distribution during the hustings. In his article, without naming Dhinakaran, Haasan said the RK Nagar bypoll win was a ""purchased"" one, alluding to alleged money distribution by the rebel camp. ""RK Nagar bypoll is a big stain on Tamil Nadu politics; it is a big stain on Indian democracy. I won't call this purchased win even a scam....this is a daylight crime,"" Haasan charged. He recalled Election Commission rescinding the bypoll for this city segment when it was to be held in April last year following complaints of money distribution. Dhinakaran was the ruling party candidate then but was later sidelined by the Palaniswami and his cabinet colleagues. The chief minister and deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, who was then a rebel leader, merged their respective factions in August last year. Dhinakaran contested last month's election as an independent candidate and polled over 89,000 votes. Haasan charged that both the ""independent"" and the ""ruling side fixed rates"" for voters. Alleging that people had voted for money, Haasan, in the article, said: ""you have been sold out."" Dhinakaran, responding to Haasan's allegations, hit out at the award-winning star, saying he had ""insulted"" and ""hurt"" the RK Nagar voters by making such allegations. Haasan's charge was ""strongly condemnable,"" he told reporters. ""This doesn't befit his age and experience. Under the garb of attacking the winner, he is attacking the people, who are mainly from poorer sections, saying they voted for money,"" Dhinakaran said. He denied bribing the voters, saying, if at all money would have played a role in the electoral outcome, ""Two Leaves (AIADMK) would have won."" ""Whether you accept or not, people of RK Nagar have voted for me. Don't hurt those lovable people (by making such allegations),"" Dhinakaran said. Questioning whether Kamal Haasan was a 'judge' or 'God,' Dhinakaran said the actor should have contested the bypoll to face the reality. Apparently hitting out at the actor's political ambitions, Dhinakaran asked: ""can such people survive in politics."" ""Politics is not some scripted movie where one can mouth dialogues written by someone else,"" he said. On his victory, he said RK Nagar voters have ""recognised we are Amma's (Jayalalithaa) successors. Those who are apprehensive due to this are saying such things (of bribing the voters)"". Dhinakaran dared those making such allegations to reiterate them by holding a public meeting at RK Nagar. Haasan, who has announced his intentions of entering politics, has been vocal on a number of issues ranging from corruption to right-wing extremism.",PTI,Press Trust of India
"Amid reported clashes between the Left front and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the new Tripura Cabinet will be sworn in on Friday at 12 pm. Biplab Deb will be sworn in as the chief minister of Tripura at the Assam Rifles ground on Friday which will usher in the first BJP government in the northeastern state. Forty-eight-year-old Deb staked claim to Governor Tathagata Roy on 6 March to form the government in the state. The governor then invited him to do so. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and three chief ministers of BJP-ruled states in the northeastern region would be present at the swearing-in ceremony, state BJP spokesperson Mrinal Kanti Deb told  . ""All the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states and the members of the BJP parliamentary board have been invited to attend the swearing-in ceremony,” he said. A long-time RSS worker, Deb has been largely credited for the BJP's turnaround in Tripura. The BJP-Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) combine swept to power in the state last week, ending 25 years of uninterrupted rule of the CPM-led Left Front. The BJP had bagged 35 seats and the IPFT eight in the 60-member House. Union minister Nitin Gadkari had stated on 6 March that Jishnu Debbarma will be the deputy chief minister. Debbarma is yet to be elected as an MLA as polling in his Charilam (Scheduled Tribe) constituency was postponed due to the death of the CPM candidate. The election will now be held on 12 March. IPFT president NC Debbarma said the party would get two berths in the new cabinet which was decided at a meeting with BJP leader and the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) chairman Himanta Biswa Sarma. Outgoing chief minister Manik Sarkar and former ministers of his cabinet would attend the ceremony, Left Front convener Bijan Dhar told  However, leaders of the opposition Left parties would not join the programme in protest against post-poll violence in the state, said Dhar, also CPM state secretary. ""The outgoing chief minister and his ministers would attend the swearing-in ceremony. Left parties have also been invited to join it. But we will not go there to protest against the post-poll violence,"" Dhar told a press conference.",FP Staff,FP Staff
" The Congress and the NCP will hopefully announce a seat-sharing arrangement well ahead of next year's Maharashtra Assembly polls, Congress leader Milind Deora said and pitched for roping in more ""like-minded"" parties into the coalition to defeat the ruling BJP. He said there is a ""small section"" in the Congress which feels even the Shiv Sena, a sulking ally of the BJP, could be considered for a poll tie-up, but ""a vast majority of the party is convinced that that is not even an option"". In an interview to  , Deora described the NCP as an important partner for the Congress, both at the state level and the central level. ""I don't think there is any doubt within the Congress whether we should have an alliance with the NCP. In fact, I am hopeful that we would be able to announce seat-sharing details well in advance,"" the 41-year-old leader said. The Assembly polls in Maharashtra are due towards the end of next year. Praising Sharad Pawar, Deora said the NCP chief has ""a wealth of knowledge"" of Maharashtra politics and ""a great deal of personal relations"" with different parties that can work with the Congress at the central level. ""In Maharashtra in particular, we should look at other parties,"" the former Union minister said. Refusing to name any party, Deora said, ""There may be other parties...There are certainly other parties, like-minded parties, who we should look at roping in and be involving them in the alliance who have credibility among the voters in Maharashtra and are concerned over the state of affairs in the country."" He was asked whether the Congress could think of roping in the Shiv Sena, which is unhappy with its ally BJP. ""There are very small sections in the party who believe that that might be possible. To be frank, a vast majority of the party is convinced that that is not even an option. There are vast ideological differences (between Sena and Congress),"" Deora replied. He said the Congress could not subscribe to the politics the Shiv Sena represents. ""Shiv Sena and MNS are parties which believe that if you are north Indian, south Indian, Marwadi, Jain, who have lived in Maharashtra for years, they believe they are not Maharashtrians... The general view in the Congress is that it is not something which can be accepted,"" Deora said. ""But, if they start to change that (approach) and the party (Shiv Sena) transforms itself, who knows, anything is possible. For that parties like them will have to walk a massive distance and will have to very much shed the basis on which they were formed,"" he said. Asked whether a tie-up could be considered if the Shiv Sena or the Raj Thackeray-led MNS change themselves, Deora responded, ""Even if they change colours, we will have to see are they genuine about it, are they doing it for political opportunism... As of now, I don't see any intention of these parties to transform."" His attention was drawn to the recent comments by DP Tripathi, a leader of ally NCP, that Shiv Sena ""does not pose a danger to secularism"". In response, Deora said, ""The Shiv Sena certainly has not had a good record on secularism and pluralism. So that is his (Tripathi's) view, his party's view. My view and my party's view is different. ""My view and my party's view is that simply saying you are against the BJP doesn't mean that a coalition can be formed, at least a formal coalition can be formed which is inclusive of parties which have had a history of having a divisive agenda."" Asked whether the Congress-NCP alliance should declare its chief ministerial candidate before the polls, Deora said it would need to be discussed among the leaders in his party in Maharashtra and in Delhi besides the coalition partners. ""It is very early to say that. First, we will have to sit and discuss seat-sharing and discuss contours of the alliance. There are many other things that go into an alliance,"" the former Lok Sabha MP from Mumbai South added.",PTI,Press Trust of India
"The death toll from the bombings, shellings and alleged chemical weapon use, in Syria’s Eastern Ghouta has crossed 600, since it began late February. Many among the dead are unarmed civilians: men, women, and children, who have lost their lives in one of the most devastating campaigns of the Syrian war. Despite a call for a “five-hour daily truce” from Syrian Government-backer Russia, residents of Eastern Ghouta said government warplanes resumed striking the eastern Ghouta region after a brief lull. On Sunday 25 February, Syrian health authorities said several people had suffered symptoms consistent with chlorine gas exposure and on Monday 26 February, rescue workers and a war monitor said seven small children were killed by air and artillery strikes in one town. Diplomatic sources meanwhile said the chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, opened an investigation into attacks in eastern Ghouta to determine whether banned munitions were used. Political leaders in France, the United States and Britain said this month they would back targeted military action against Damascus if there were proof chemical weapons had been used by forces under President Bashar al-Assad, Russia's ally. Syrian Government-backer Russia, and Damascus, blamed rebels for the collapse of the truce, saying fighters had shelled several “safe routes” intended for civilians to leave the enclave. The insurgents denied such shelling, and a senior US general accused Russia acting as ""both arsonist and firefighter"" by failing to rein in Assad. The United States, called Russia’s proposal for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians “a joke,” adding that people are afraid to use them for fear of conscription, exile, or death at the hands of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. Fighting has raged across Syria since the resolution on Saturday 24 February, as Turkey presses its offensive against a Kurdish militia in Afrin, rival rebel groups fight each other in Idlib and a US-led coalition targets Islamic State in the east. Mohamad Alloush, the political chief of one of eastern Ghouta's biggest rebel factions, said the Syrian army and its allies had launched ""a sweeping ground assault"" after the UN resolution, adding it was vital that the truce be implemented. ""We hope for real, serious, practical action,"" he said. A picture issued by Civil Defence rescue workers, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed seven small bodies lying next to each other, wrapped in white and blue sheets, after air and artillery strikes on the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said allegations the Syrian government was responsible for any chemical attack, after reports of people suffering symptoms of chlorine gas poisoning, were aimed at sabotaging the truce. The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons in the war, which will soon enter its eighth year having killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced half of Syria's pre-war population of about 23 million from their homes. The intensity of the bombardment has diminished since the UN resolution, the Observatory said, but it added that 21 people had been killed in eastern Ghouta on Monday 26 February, including the seven small children in the photograph. Rebel shelling has caused 36 deaths and a number of injuries in Damascus and nearby rural areas in the last four days, Zaher Hajjo, a government health official, told Reuters. Speaking in Riyadh, deputy director general of the World Health Organisation, Peter Salama, said the WHO urgently needed to evacuate 750 medical cases from eastern Ghouta. ""We also need sustained access for medical equipment and for medical drugs and commodities,"" he said, adding that some supplies had been ""systematically In eastern Ghouta, people were making use of a relative lull in the bombardment to find provisions, said Moayad Hafi, a rescue worker based there. Lavrov said the ceasefire would not cover either the Ahrar al-Sham or the Jaish al-Islam factions, describing them as partners of the former al Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front. The two major rebel factions in eastern Ghouta are Jaish al-Islam and Failaq al-Rahman. Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of jihadists including Nusra, also has a small presence there. ""Partners of al-Nusra are not protected by the ceasefire regime. They are also subject to the legitimate actions of Syrian armed forces and all those who support the Syrian army,"" said Lavrov. In Idlib, Ahrar al-Sham and Tahrir al-Sham have been battling each other in recent days, rather than working in partnership. Syrian state television reported that army units had advanced against militants near Harasta in eastern Ghouta. State news agency SANA also reported that the army had stopped a car bomb being driven into Damascus. The Nusra Front has consistently been excluded from ceasefires in Syria, and the opposition says the government has used this as an excuse to keep up its bombardments.

A resolution will be brought in the monsoon session of the Odisha legislative Assembly beginning from 4 September for formation of Odisha Legislative Council, he said. The proposed legislative council will have 49 members, the minister said adding that the state will have to spend Rs 35 crore annually for creation of the vidhan parishad. The members of the proposed council will get salary and allowance as given to the members of the legislative Assembly. As per article 171 clause (1) of the Indian Constitution, the total number of members in the legislative council of a state shall not exceed one third of the total number of the members in the legislative Assembly of that state and the total number of members in the legislative council of a state shall in no case be less than 40.

"Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s iftar party on Wednesday saw many Opposition members and diplomats in attendance. However, the lustre of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi’s dinner in March 2018 was largely missing. Sonia's dinner was attended by all top leaders of the Opposition including NCP chief Sharad Pawar, his colleague Praful Patel, Samajwadi Party veteran Ramgopal Yadav, RJD chief Lalu Yadav’s son Tejaswi Yadav and Omar Abdullah of the National Conference.  However, as Sonia herself missed Rahul's party owing to her ongoing treatment abroad, many top leaders of the 'federal front' too were conspicuous by their absence. West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee and BSP supremo Mayawati chose to skip the dinner. In fact, there was even speculation on whether former president Pranab Mukherjee would be invited to the bash since he had drawn the party's ire after his controversial visit to the RSS headquarters last week. But Congress later issued an official statement to set at rest the rumours by saying that the former president had indeed been invited. However, Mukherjee, who sat beside Rahul on the dinner table, left after a while. This was the first ever iftar party to be hosted by Rahul as Congress president. The party did not hold iftar, which marks the customary breaking of the day-long fast in the holy month of Ramzan, in 2016 and 2017. However, this year's iftar bash was being keenly watched in the political circles for the  'show of unity' of opposition leaders at a time when the Congress is positioning itself as the center of the 'federal front' ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Interestingly sources reported that Telangana chief minister and TRS chief K Chandrashekhar Rao, Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and Delhi chief minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal were not invited for the event. These developments are crucial in the current political context and the emerging third-front scenario as not all regional leaders are in favour of a Congress-led united Opposition. Many of them including Chandrababu Naidu, have already made it clear that they are looking to build a 'non-BJP, non-Congress' alliance ahead of the general elections in 2019. Meanwhile, earlier this week Akhilesh Yadav too warned his party members of the possibility that BSP might join hands with the Congress instead of supporting the Samajwadi Party, which won't be a favourable scenario for their political ambitions to unfold. Though, Rahul's party was not a complete no-show either as former president Pratibha Patil, former vice president Hamid Ansari and former prime minister Manmohan Singh marked their attendance at the event which was held in the Taj Mansingh hotel in New Delhi. Other attendees at the bash included CPM chief Sitaram Yechury, senior BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra, DMK’s Kanimozhi and TMC's Dinesh Trivedi. “The larger message is that almost all Opposition parties came for the iftar and interacted with each other.  ,"" a senior Opposition leader told  While a Muslim leader of the Opposition said, “At a time when the BJP has abandoned the culture and practice of iftar in Delhi, this is a good signal to the community.” RJD leader Manoj Jha, rebel JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha’s Hemant Soren, JD(S) leader Danish Ali, All India United Democratic Front chief Badruddin Ajmal and a lawmaker from the Indian Union Muslim League were among the others who attended the iftar along with several top diplomats like Russian Ambassador to India Nikolay R Kudashev, according to  Senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor, Sheila Dixit, AK Antony, Anand Sharma and Mallikarjun Kharge also attended the party along with NCP leader DP Tripathy and RLD's Mehrajuddin.

" Mohd. Ibrahim  Hera Khan, Shohini Bose As the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh’s lecture series   in Delhi concluded on Wednesday, 19 September, the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat batted for construction of the Ram Mandir at the earliest, for harmony among Hindu and Muslims, cow protection and Section 377. Talking at the conclave, Bhagwat said, “Hindutva is getting a great reception world across. It's (only) in India, (that a) hue and cry is made over it.” “Cow is a subject of traditional faith. Cow can become the base for rural ecosystem of small farmers. Cow is beneficial in many ways. Earlier, no one talked of Desi cow milk. But now they are,” Bhagwat said, adding that taking law in one's own hand, violence or destructing property, is totally inappropriate. “Due process of law should follow. The guilty should be punished,” he said. Here are the highlights from Bhagwat’s speech on the final day of the RSS event: Talking about Section 377, Bhagwat said that everybody is part of society and while some people are different, they are part of the same society. He also mentioned that with changing times, there is a need to ensure a healthy society. Bhagwat also said that the society needs to move ahead without a caste system. “Making it a reality will be tough, but we will make it happen. We don’t ask for caste in Sangh. As long as there is quota and reservation, we will continue to be divided along caste,” the RSS chief said. “Cow protectors shouldn’t be equated with those anti-social vigilantes. The society needs to be made aware. Only then, cows will be protected and the country will benefit,” he added. However, he said that the need for a person to learn his or her mother tongue, was paramount. “There is no need to be hostile towards any foreign language. We can learn other languages, but there’s a need for mother tongue education. For that, (we have to) make up our mind first, not the law. All Indian languages are ours. They all are great,” he said.

""The way I am looking at it from the North East, the only person who can unseat the BJP is Nitish Kumar,"" state NPP president WR Kharlukhi told reporters in Shillong. ""I am telling you, may be in 2019, Nitish Kumar will be the prime minister. Mark my words,"" he added. Kharlukhi, however, said, ""I will leave it to the intelligence of the Congress...But the way I am assessing the political situation in India, that is the only solution for them, not Rahul Gandhi."" Bihar chief minister Kumar had severed his ties with the RJD and Congress in the Grand Alliance last year and joined hands with the BJP to form a coalition government in the state. Once considered a potential political rival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kumar's JD(U) is now part of the ruling NDA at the Centre. The NPP has released the names of 52 candidates in poll-bound Meghalaya, while the BJP made public its first list of 45 candidates in the north-eastern state on Friday. The poll results for the 60-member Meghalaya Assembly will be declared on 3 March, along with the outcome of the Tripura and Nagaland Assembly polls. According to Kharlukhi, there was nothing unusual in the two parties parting ways for the Meghalaya polls. He pointed out that the NPP was part of the UPA, when party MP Agatha Sangma was made a minister, but the party fought against the Congress in the 2013 Meghalaya election. ""We are very clear that we are a party of our own. We have our own ideology. The NPP is the National People's Party, while the BJP is the Bharatiya Janata Party,"" Kharlukhi said. Reacting to the allegation of Chief Minister Mukul Sangma that the NPP was funded by the BJP, he said, ""The chief minister said it as if he was the treasurer of the BJP. Only the treasurer will know how much money is coming in and going out of the BJP."" Alleging that Meghalaya had suffered under the Congress rule, the NPP leader said the ruling party was levelling false allegations, hoping that it would not have to show to the people what they had done in all these years. ""It is a real pity that Meghalaya is ranked at the bottom of all the small states in every sector today. In general, it is on number 10 out of 10 states. In law-and-order, it is ranked 9, if you take tourism, it is ranked 10, in the states' economy, it is ranked 9, in health, it is ranked 8, except for agriculture where it is ranked 4,"" he said. Stating that states like Nagaland were doing better than Meghalaya, Kharlukhi said the state had performed badly in education as well, even though it was known as an education hub.",PTI,Press Trust of India

This will be for the third time the fifteenth Assembly will be meeting after the Assembly polls in May, which yielded a fractured verdict with BJP emerging as the single largest party, but falling short of numbers to form the government.

The session is beginning on Monday against the backdrop of discordant notes emerging from the Congress and JDS even on the issue of presenting a full-fledged budget and over several ministerial aspirants in both parties failing to make it to the cabinet. On the other hand, the Opposition BJP, which has termed the government as an ""unholy alliance"", is all set to corner it on a host of issues, including the discord between the coalition partners affecting governance and delay in the implementation of the much-hyped farm loan waiver that JD(S) had promised to implement within 24 hours of coming to power. With the five-member committee set up by the Congress-JD(S) coordination committee to draft a common minimum programme for the coalition government, ready with its report that includes crop loan waiver, the focus will be now on the budget to be presented on 5 July, by Kumaraswamy, who also holds the finance portfolio. Divergent views have been aired in public by some Congress and JDS leaders on several issues, including presentation of the Budget. Siddaramaiah, who held the finance portfolio in the previous government, had recently said there was no need for a fresh budget and insisted that a supplementary budget would do. Adding to the coalition's discomfort is the controversy over a video that purportedly showed coordination committee chairman Siddaramaiah's remarks, questioning the need for a fresh budget and expressing scepticism over the longevity of the government.

": Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa on Friday hit out at the Siddaramaiah government for using issues like state flag and separate religion status to Veerashaivas/ Lingayats for political reasons ahead of the Assembly polls. ""At a time when the election is coming in about 45-50 days, when the election code of conduct will come into place shortly, what is your intention in coming up with Lingayat/Veerashaiva or Karnataka flag issue?"" Yeddyurappa asked. Amid reports of differences between ministers,the Cabinet on Thursday discussed inconclusively recommending to the Centre to accord ""religious minority"" status to the dominant community. It will take up the issue again at the next cabinet meeting on 14 March. According to reports, differences between ministers in the cabinet belonging to both Veerashaivas and Lingayats resulted in no decision being arrived at. Commenting on differences within the cabinet on the issue, Yeddyurappa said ""Wait for some time.... you people know and have reported about what is happening in the cabinet. You wait and see how twists and turns will happen."" ""Despite the issue being discussed in the cabinet for about three-and-half hours (yesterday), it was inconclusive, they have deferred,"" he told reporters. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has however clarified that paucity of time at the cabinet yesterday had led to discussions on the issue being inconclusive. The demand for a separate religion tag to Veerashaiva/ Lingayat faiths has surfaced from the numerically strong and politically-influential community, amidst resentment from within over projecting the two communities as the same. While one section led by Akhila Bharata Veerashaiva Mahasabha has demanded separate religion status, asserting that Veerashaivas and Lingayats are the same, the other wants it only for Lingayats as they believe Veerashaivais are one among the seven sects of Shaivites, which is part of Hinduism. Karnataka State Minorities Commission had formed a seven member committee, headed by retired high court Judge HN Nagamohan Das on the issue, which submitted its report on 2 March, stating that Lingayats in Karnataka may be considered as a religious minority. On BJP's stand on the proposed official state flag, Yeddyurappa said his party does not have any reservation if the common man agrees, but questioned it's timing. ""We don't want to make any comment on this issue...common man's opinion should be taken... if the common man agrees, we also agree, we don't have any reservation,"" he said. Questioning the government what they were doing for over four-and-half years, he said ""when you are about to go home, why are you playing this as a political game.

The Indian Air Force issued the RFI (Request for Information) or initial tender for the billion dollar procurement deal which will be in sync with the government's ‘Make in India’ initiative. Officials said the jets will be produced jointly by a foreign aircraft maker along with an Indian company under the recently-launched strategic partnership model which aims to bring in high-end defence technology to India. Leading military aircraft producers Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Saab and Dassault are among the competitors which are likely to vie for the mega deal. The IAF has been pressing for expediting the process to acquire the aircraft citing declining strength of its fighter squadron as some of the ageing jets are being phased out. It is the first mega procurement initiative for fighter jets after the government scrapped the process to acquire 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force around five years ago.

He termed Sonia Gandhi — who recently stepped down as the Congress president but continues to be parliamentary party leader and UPA chairperson — as an ""inspirational personality"" for his party, the UPA allies and for the country. ""The Congress has never intended to impose its leadership on anybody (the UPA allies). It's a question of how you approach. There should be a pan-India personality of a political party, particularly to lead an alliance against the communal party like the BJP, you require a credible and pan-Indian personality...party,"" he said. On suggestions that the Congress lost out in the recent Gujarat Assembly elections as it did not project a chief ministerial candidate, Moily said it may be one of the reasons but it's not the sole one. The Congress cannot have a uniform policy on projecting a leader for the post of chief minister as it depends on the situation and circumstances in the party as well as the states concerned, he said.

" The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre, Delhi government and other authorities concerned not to make unauthorised construction and sealing of illegal structures in the national capital ""political"" issues. A bench comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said this after Additional Solicitor General ANS Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre, informed the court that they had held meetings with all the agencies concerned and they had proposed to constitute a special task force for monitoring all the issues arising out of unauthorised constructions. ""There are a few points and you please take these into account. This is not a political issue,"" the bench said. The apex court also asked the authorities to look into the aspects of fire safety, especially in schools, and the massive depletion of groundwater while proceeding in the matter. The bench also made it clear to the authorities that the health of the citizens of Delhi was much more important than profit and they would have to deal with the issue in a holistic manner. The bench has now posted the matter for further hearing on 18 April. The apex court had on 4 April lashed out at the Centre, Delhi government and civic agencies for their failure to stop unauthorised constructions in the national capital, saying that ""lungs"" of the citizens, especially children, were ""damaged"" due to inaction of the authorities. The top court was critical of the continuous inaction by the authorities and said that the people of Delhi were suffering with problems such as pollution, parking and lack of green areas due to the issues arising out of unauthorised constructions. The top court is hearing arguments on the validity of the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006 and subsequent legislation which protect unauthorised construction from being sealed. 
The apex court had earlier ordered restoration of its 2006 monitoring committee to identify and seal such offending structures.

" The Opposition BJP on Thursday fielded senior leader S Suresh Kumar as its candidate in the election for the post of Karnataka Assembly speaker to be held on Friday, apparently to force a trial of strength before the HD Kumaraswamy government seeks vote of confidence. Kumar, a fifth term MLA from the city, filed his nomination papers before Assembly Secretary S Murthy at Vidhana Soudha, the seat of the state legislature. The Congress-JD(S) coalition, which claims to enjoy the support of 117 MLAs, has plumped for Congress' Ramesh Kumar, a former speaker, as its candidate for the post. Ramesh Kumar also filed his nomination papers. Suresh Kumar told reporters that he has filed his nomination on the directions from BJP's state unit chief BS Yeddyurappa and other leaders. ""Based on the strength of numbers and various other factors, our party leaders have confidence that I will win. With that confidence I have filed my nomination,"" he said. Asked about his chances of winning since the BJP has only 104 MLAs on its side, Suresh Kumar said, ""I have filed my nomination. There is election tomorrow at 12.15 pm. After the election you will get to know (the outcome)."" Suresh Kumar was accompanied by two BJP MLAs CN Ashwathnarayan and Sunil Kumar while filing the nomination. In contrast, Ramesh Kumar was accompanied by Karnataka state Congress president and Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, former chief minister Siddaramaiah and a host of Congress MLAs and leaders, while filing the nomination. The Congress and JD(S) had unanimously chosen Ramesh Kumar as their candidate for the Speaker's post, Siddaramaiah told reporters after the nomination was filed. He said, ""I got to know that the BJP has also filed nomination... I hope they will withdraw. If election happens Ramesh Kumar's victory is certain."" Pointing out that Ramesh Kumar has experience as Speaker (from 1994 to 1999), Siddaramaiah said, he was known as a good presiding officer and had conducted House proceedings in a smooth manner then. After the election of the Speaker, the crucial floor test will take place, when Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy will seek vote of confidence. Kumaraswamy and his deputy Congress' G Parameshwara were sworn-in yesterday at a ceremony that turned into a grand spectacle of unity by leaders of regional parties of various hues, signalling emergence of an anti-BJP bloc for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The three-day-old BS Yeddyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka had collapsed on 19 May, with the chief minister announcing his decision to resign without facing a trust vote, with the numbers not in his favour. Governor Vajubhai Vala had then invited Kumaraswamy to form the government and prove his majority within 15 days.",PTI,PTI

" Many men and women MPs spoke on empowerment of women in the Rajya Sabha. Derek O'Brien, while speaking on the issue, also took a dig at the Modi government over the PNB scam. International Women's Day was recognised in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Sumitra Mahajan said women empowerment was one of the challenges in the world today. The proceedings in both Houses of Parliament were washed out for the third straight day on Wednesday, as Opposition parties as well as NDA allies Shiv Sena, TDP and AIADMK stalled business vociferously protesting on issues like vandalisation of statues and the banking fraud. While the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day just after noon, the Rajya Sabha witnessed similar scenes and was first adjourned till 2 pm and then for the day. The Upper House also saw Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu expressing concern over the vandalisation of statues in different parts of the country and saying, ""the statues were vandalised...It's a shame. It's mad, mad, mad...Whoever does it, whether it is in Tamil Nadu, whether it is West Bengal or Tripura."" When the Lok Sabha met for the day, members of various parties, including TDP, Shiv Sena, TRS, YSR Congress, AIADMK and Trinamool Congress started raising slogans on different issues, forcing Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, who had taken up the Question Hour, to adjourn the proceedings for an hour within minutes. She was visibly upset when she left the House even as the din continued. Amid the ruckus, a Lok Sabha official had to repeat loudly that the House has been adjourned till noon. While Congress members were pressing for a reply from the prime minister on the Rs 13,000 crore bank fraud allegedly involving diamantaire Nirav Modi, members of AIADMK and AAP were in the Well, holding photos of Periyar, and raising slogans condemning the vandalism in Vellore in which the statue of Dravidian icon Thanthai Periyar was defaced. The TRS members were raising slogans demanding a hike in Telangana's quota in reservation, while TDP pressed for grant of special status for Andhra Pradesh and the Shiv Sena sought classical language status for Marathi. The AIADMK, which has been protesting for the past two days seeking creation of Cauvery water management board, on Wednesday also protested against vandalisation of statues, while the YSR Congress demanded implementation of the AP Reorganisation Act. When the House reassembled at noon, the protesting members were already in the Well. Mahajan then asked Shiv Sena member Anandrao Adsul to speak on his demand. Adsul said Marathi was an ancient language and fulfilled all the criteria for grant of the classical language status and added that Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia have already been given the classical language status. ""Several of our members have raised this issue repeatedly. We have given our submission to the minister but our demand has not been fulfilled till date,"" Adsul said. In response, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who was present in the House, assured Adsul that the matter would be looked into. ""The issue does not pertain to the Home Ministry. I will speak to the Culture Ministry on this,"" Singh said. Thereafter, even as Shiv Sena stopped their protest on the issue, AIADMK members continued to raise slogans against the desecration of the statue of Periyar — the founder of Dravidian movement. ""We strongly condemn vandalisation of statute of Thanthai Periyar by BJP members,"" read the placards held by AIADMK members. After the Home Minister's reply, as the uproarious scenes continued, the House was adjourned for the day. In the Rajya Sabha, the same issues were raised by the opposition parties, which led to the first adjournment till 2 pm soon after 11 am when it met for the day. The Chair called it a day as similar scenes were witnessed at 2 pm. In the morning, the House also paid tributes to former Rajya Sabha member Jinendra Kumar Jain, who passed away earlier this month. But as soon as the listed papers were laid during the Zero Hour and the Chairman expressed concern over vandalisation of statues in different parts of the country, MPs from the Congress, TMC, Left parties, NDA ally TDP and AIADMK among others rushed into the Well shouting slogans. Congress and Left party members were on their feet protesting the incidents of destroying statues of Periyar in Tripura and Vladimir Illyich Lenin in Tripura. To this, Naidu said ""statues were vandalised in different parts of the country. It is a shame. It's mad, whoever does it, whether it is in Tamil Nadu, whether it is West Bengal or whether it is in Tripura."" He also told the agitating members that the government has agreed and he has given permission to hold debate on all issues being raised by them, including the bank fraud, Cauvery river water issue and matters concerning Andhra Pradesh. ""We are ready to discuss all issues,"" Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said in an attempt to restore order. Disappointed with the members protesting in the Well and raising slogans, the chairman said such acts were ""bad"" and ""against democracy"". However, as the noisy protests continued unabated, Naidu adjourned the House till 2 pm. When the House reassembled, similar protests continued. Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien again told the agitating members that the government has agreed to discuss the issues they were raising. He urged the protestors to return to their seats and restore order. However, as his appeals went unheeded, Kurien adjourned the House for the day, shortly after it had recommenced.",FP Staff,FP Staff

" Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday claimed that he knew ""from the very beginning"" that his alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD ""would not last for more than a year-and-a-half"", but he did his best to carry on in the Grand Alliance, which ultimately disintegrated last year. The Grand Alliance ministry, headed by Kumar, collapsed in July last year after the chief minister resigned over graft charge against his then deputy, Tejashwi Yadav. Subsequently, Kumar joined hands with the BJP to form another coalition government in Bihar. ""The very day the Mahagathbandhan government was installed, I had said to those close to me that this was not going to last for more than a year-and-a-half. I knew it from the very beginning. I still managed to carry on for 20 months,"" the JD(U) chief told reporters in Patna on the sidelines of his weekly "" "" (public interaction) programme. He said this while reacting to the allegations of ""betrayal of mandate"", levelled against him by the RJD and the Congress — the two other constituents of the erstwhile ""Mahagathbandhan"". The Grand Alliance was formed shortly after the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when Kumar and Prasad decided to bury the hatchet. Both the JD(U) and the RJD had suffered a severe drubbing in the Parliamentary election, which saw the BJP putting up its best-ever electoral performance, riding on a strong wave in favour of Narendra Modi. However, Kumar's statement drew flak from former JD(U) president Sharad Yadav, who had raised a banner of revolt when the Bihar chief minister joined hands with the BJP. ""If he (Kumar) knew that the alliance was not going to last, why did he agree to such a tie-up in the first place. It is an illogical thing to say. He is suffering from pangs of guilt for his volte-face and trying to justify his actions by such utterances,"" Yadav told a TV news channel in Delhi. Yadav was disqualified from the Rajya Sabha a couple of months ago, following an application by the JD(U), which had held that the former party president's presence at rallies and meetings organised by the RJD-Congress combine were tantamount to his having ""voluntarily renounced"" the membership of the party. Reacting to Kumar's statement, Tejashwi Yadav tweeted, saying, ""This is what I have been saying since the beginning that Tejashwi was just an excuse.   (turncoat uncle) had vicious plans beforehand."" ""The respected 67-year-old should be ashamed that he made a 28-year-old an excuse for his shenanigans.

" The Congress let its ally NCP contest in the by-election to the Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha constituency fearing that a section of NCP workers might not cooperate if it had fielded its leader Nana Patole from the seat, sources have said. Patole, who as a BJP candidate had defeated NCP heavyweight Praful Patel from the constituency in the 2014 parliamentary election, was keen on contesting on a Congress ticket this time, the sources said. Patole quit as the BJP MP and resigned from the ruling party to return to the Congress earlier this year, necessitating the by-election. The sources added that fielding Patole, who quit the BJP criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis over several issues including agrarian crisis, would have made the ruling party leave no stone unturned to see the former MP was defeated in the 28 May by-election. “Had Patole contested, the BJP would have launched an aggressive campaign to defeat him given his criticism of Modi and Fadnavis.

Popularly known as the ""rebel star"", Ambareesh is a Vokkaliga leader and wields considerable clout in the Mandya region, where the community has a large presence. Noting he had undergone treatment four years ago in Singapore, he said, ""It will be difficult. People would have kept faith in us...I will not be able to do things. When I know I can't it is good to remain silent."" The Congress sources said that the B-form was issued to Ambareesh at his residence, as he did not collect it from the party office. Ambareesh is said to be miffed with the party and chief minister Siddaramaiah as he was dropped from the ministry in 2016 during a major rejig of the cabinet. The veteran actor was housing minister then.  He said, ""Siddaramaiah had removed me (from the cabinet). If I was not capable then, will I be made minister again? They won't. I will have to sit as an MLA because the people of Mandya will obviously vote and send me to assembly, because of their love towards me."" Asked whether he was still upset with the party and the chief minister for being dropped, he said, ""I'm only saying I know my capability. What is being upset about it? Ambareesh is never upset.""",PTI,PTI
"After days of high political drama, the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) alliance scored a victory in the Karnataka elections, after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief minister BS Yeddyurappa failed to establish majority on the floor of the House and tendered his resignation. “I am proud that the Opposition stood together and defeated the BJP and we will continue to do so,” Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said at a press conference, moments after Yeddyurappa ’s resignation. Accusing the BJP of horse-trading, Gandhi alleged that PM Narendra Modi’s claims of the BJP being corruption-free were “blatant lies”. Hours after the Yeddyurappa’s resignation, former CM Siddaramaiah thanked Rahul Gandhi and hailed it as the “start towards building a National Alliance of progressive and secular forces for 2019”. Reacting to the development, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Reddy dubbed it a great victory for democracy. Expressing confidence that the Congress would win the 2019 elections, he reportedly asserted that nothing could “stop Rahul Gandhi from becoming the Prime Minister of India”. While the Congress-JD(S) combine cheered their bitterly-fought win, Opposition members bombarded the coalition with congratulatory messages. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called it a “victory of democracy”. MK Stalin of the Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) reiterated Mamata’s sentiments. The DMK working president, who also congratulated JD(S)’ Kumaraswamy on the phone, lashed out at the BJP’s “systematic abuse of Governor’s office and wanton misuse of Speaker’s powers”. DMK leader Kanimozhi praised the Supreme Court for its intervention in the matter, and called it a victory for not just the Congress-JD(S) combine, but also the Opposition parties supporting the alliance in spirit. Meanwhile, Tamil actor Rajinikanth, on Sunday, 20 May, said that the development in the neighbouring state was a victory for democracy, reported PTI. Dubbing as ""farcical"" the time of 15 days given by Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala to Yeddyurappa to prove his majority, Rajinikanth said that it should not have been done. ""Hats off to the Supreme Court which gave a good ruling,"" he said, apparently referring to the apex court asking the BJP to take the floor test to prove its majority in the House on Saturday. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said it was a big blow to the BJP. “This is a big blow for them (BJP) and I think what they had been planning all along for 2019 has failed, they will now have to rethink and alter their strategies,” said Mayawati. Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu said that all those who believe in democracy should rejoice. “Resignation of Yeddyurappa as Karnataka CM is a true victory for democracy. Entire nation is happy with the current turn of events. As a Chief Minister and a firm believer of democracy, I am expressing my happiness,” he said. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also tweeted calling the events in Karnataka a victory of truth. Taking to Twitter, actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan also hailed it as a victory of democracy, saying, “Let the democratic light born in Karnataka spread all over the country.

"Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said he had made four calls to enquire about ally-turned adversary Lalu Prasad's health out of human consideration and without any political motivation. His remark came days after Prasad's younger son Tejashwi Yadav   in a tweet on 27 June after the RJD supremo underwent a fistula surgery at a Mumbai-based hospital. ""I called up four times to enquire about Lalu ji's health, who has been an old associate, keeping aside political differences, "" the chief minister told reporters after his weekly public interaction programme Lok Samvad in Patna. ""I called up and spoke to Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha when Lalu ji was admitted at AIIMS in Delhi. I spoke to Bhola Yadav (MLA and Prasad's close aide) on at least three occasions. When I spoke to him after the completion of surgery, Bhola Yadav handed over the phone to his recuperating leader,"" he said. Kumar and Prasad are products of the 1974 Janata Party movement and were popularly referred as ""Bade Bhai (Lalu) and Chhote Bhai (Nitish)"" in the political circle due to their age difference. Kumar had separated from Prasad in 1994 to form the Samata Party that became an ally of the BJP in the NDA, and after a long gap, they had teamed up again in 2015 for the Bihar Assembly polls. But their renewed friendship did not last long and they parted ways last year, leading to the disintegration of the Grand Alliance, which also comprised the Congress. Tejashwi, who had served as Kumar's deputy in the previous Grand Alliance government in Bihar, had dismissed the gesture as ""nothing but a late courtesy call"". He had alleged that the chief minister got to know about his father's ill-health after four months of hospitalisation. However, Kumar said, ""People today react to things about which they do not have adequate knowledge."" They take to social media at a drop of the hat and react in haste, he said. ""It seems no appreciation is left for gestures arising out of human consideration, not motivated by political gains,"" Kumar said. The telephone call on 26 June had triggered speculations that the JD(U) chief was growing uncomfortable in the BJP-led NDA and was making attempts to return to the Grand Alliance, comprising the RJD and the Congress. Kumar also dismissed as ' ' (laughable) the recent act of Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, wherein he had waved a placard with 'No entry for Nitish uncle' written on it. Earlier, Tejashwi, whom the RJD has declared as its chief ministerial candidate for the next assembly polls, had stated that the door is closed for Kumar's return to the Grand Alliance. He had also dismissed speculations that the Congress was open to such a possibility if the chief minister snaps ties with the BJP. Replying to a question, Kumar said that his party was, in-principle, in favour of holding of Lok Sabha and Assembly elections simultaneously across the country, but it required a lot of preparation. The JD(U) chief said a lot of things will have to be considered and even constitutional provisions would have to be re-examined as terms of Lok Sabha or a legislative assembly under the existing system could neither be extended nor reduced. ""Therefore, let alone simultaneous polls in 2019, I do not think it would be possible to hold simultaneous polls even in 2024,"" Kumar said replying to queries about a resolution adopted by the JD(U)at its national executive meet in New Delhi on Sunday favouring 'one nation, one poll'. He also stressed the need for state-funding of elections, saying it was a much-needed electoral reform for the country to eliminate improper use of money power in polls. On the issue of prohibition of liquor, which was introduced in Bihar two years ago, the chief minister said my party and the BJP share support for this measure in the state. Replying to further queries on the issue of support for prohibition outside the state, he said, ""I have had no talks with any other party or government outside the state."" His remark came amid reports about alleged smuggling of liquor into Bihar from other states, particularly BJP-ruled ones such as Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. He also said if provisions of the existing prohibition law were creating any problems, his government would bring forward necessary amendments in the upcoming Monsoon Session of the state legislature.",Press Trust of India,Press Trust of India
" The Supreme Court on Wednesday once again refused to stay its verdict which allowed entry of women of all age groups into Kerala’s Sabarimala temple. The apex court had on Tuesday declined a similar plea while agreeing to hear in open court a batch of petitions seeking review of its September 28 verdict by which it had lifted the ban on entry of women of menstruating age group into the Sabarimala temple. The top court has fixed January 22 to hear all the review petitions. A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi asked a lawyer, who on Wednesday sought a stay on the court’s Sabarimala verdict, to wait till January 22 when the constitution bench will hear review petitions. The matter was mentioned by lawyer Mathews J. Nedumpara, who has filed the review on behalf of the National Ayyappa Devotees (Women’s) Association. On September 28, a five-judge constitution bench, headed by the then Chief Justice Dipak Misra, in 4:1 verdict had paved the way for the entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala temple, saying the ban amounted to gender discrimination. The review petitions against the verdict were taken up on Tuesday ‘in-chamber’ by a bench comprising the CJI and Justices R.F. Nariman, A.M. Khanwilkar, D.Y. Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra. “All the review petitions along with all pending applications will be heard in Open Court on 22nd January, 2019 before the appropriate Bench. We make it clear that there is no stay of the judgment and order of this court dated 28th September 2018 passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No.373 of 2006 ( ),” the order said. In the in-chamber proceedings, the judges examine the review petitions by circulation and lawyers were not present. There are around 48 petitions seeking review of the judgement and they were filed following the recent violent protests in favour and against the verdict. The apex court had also made it clear that fresh pleas related to the matter will be heard only after it decides the earlier petitions seeking review of the judgment. The bench stated this while hearing the three fresh petitions filed by G. Vijaya Kumar, S. Jaya Rajkumar and Shailaja Vijayan challenging its September 28 verdict. The top court had on October 9 declined an urgent hearing on the review plea filed by an association which had contended that the five-judge Constitution bench’s verdict lifting the ban was “absolutely untenable and irrational”. The plea filed by the National Ayyappa Devotees Association had said: “The notion that the judgment under review is revolutionary, one which removes the stigma or the concept of dirt or pollution associated with menstruation, is unfounded”. “It is a judgment welcomed by hypocrites who were aspiring for media headlines. On the merits of the case, as well, the said judgment is absolutely untenable and irrational, if not perverse,” the plea submitted. Besides the association, several other petitions, including one by the Nair Service Society (NSS), have been filed against the apex court verdict. The NSS had said in the plea that as the deity is a ‘Naistika Brahmachari’, females below the age of ten and after the age of 50 years are eligible to worship him and there is no practice of excluding worship by females. “Hence, the delay or wait for 40 years to worship cannot be considered as exclusionary and it is an error of law on the face of the judgement,” the plea had said.",PTI,PTI
"Sunrisers Hyderabad defeated Kings XI Punjab by 13 runs, after bowling them out for 119 in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018 match on Thursday. Demoted to Number 3, Kings XI Punjab squandered a watchful 55-run opening start from Chris Gayle and Lokesh Rahul as Rashid (3/19) and Shakib (2/18) triggered a batting collapse to see the team home amid thunderous applause from the vociferous crowd at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. While Gayle (23 off 22 balls; 4x1, 6x2) started with a thunderous six over off-spinner Mohammad Nabi's head before going into a shell, Rahul (32 off 26; 4x4, 6x1) sent the Afghan tweaker to the cleaners on three consecutive occasions to outscore his West Indian opening partner. Rahul's innings was laced with a range of stylish cover drives and straight drives even as Gayle found back his groove by welcoming medium pacer Basil Thampi for a thunderous six, and helping his side past the 50-run mark. With Punjab sailing smoothly towards the target, Kane Williamson brought in his strike bowler Rashid Khan, who responded in style by hammering Rahul's off-stump with a googly. Thampi (2/14) then joined the party by getting the better of Gayle, who miscued a short ball to non-existent square-leg only to find the bowler completing a clean catch. At 57/2, Punjab needed to start afresh with Mayank Agarwal (12) and Karun Nair (13) joining forces, but left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan nipped the partnership in the bud with the wicket of Agarwal. Nair departed soon after failing to read Rashid's googly which trapped him plumb in front even as Manoj Tiwary (1) was welcomed with a couple of fiery lbw appeals from the Afghan. Punjab's nightmare continued in the next over when Shakib sent Aaron Finch (8) packing after being clobbered for a massive six on the previous ball. Medium pacer Sandeep Sharma added salt to Punjab's woes by packing Tiwary soon after as the visitors' chase derailed after losing six wickets in a span of just 37 runs. Skipper Ravichandran Ashwin (4), Andrew Tye (4) and Barinder Sran (2) could hardly offer any resistance as the home bowlers continued their stronghold. With the target gradually getting out of Punjab's hands, tailenders Mujeeb Ur Rahman (10 not out) and Ankit Rajpoot (8) got a few hits before Thampi uprooted Rajpoot's middle stick to take his team home. Earlier, medium pacer Ankit Rajpoot (5/14) ripped through the Hyderabad batting to restrict them to a paltry 132. The 24-year-old Rajpoot started off with the key wickets of skipper Kane Williamson (0), Shikhar Dhawan (11) and Wriddhiman Saha (6) from his first three overs before returning to pick up Manish Pandey (54) and Mohammad Nabi (4) in the final over of the innings. Put in to bat, the hosts were saved from the blushes by Pandey's fighting 51-ball knock, laced with three fours and a six after Rajpoot reduced them to 27/3 in the first five overs. Pandey, however found a companion in Bangladesh skipper Shakib, who made the most of the two reprieves, striking a 29-ball 28, laced with three hits to the fence and forged a 52-run fourth wicket stand. But the joy was short-lived as 17-year-old mystery spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman ended the partnership with the wicket of Shakib. Shakib's dismissal brought in an experienced Yusuf Pathan (21 not out off 19; 4x1, 6x1) who was forced to curb his natural game, even as Pandey reached his fifty by sending Tye's slower one to the extra cover boundary. Afghan all-rounder Nabi then joined Pathan for the final two deliveries but couldn't trouble the scorers much as Rajpoot had the last laugh.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

"The Centre is ready to hold talks with anyone including Pakistan but terror and dialogue can never go together, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Srinagar, on Tuesday, 23 October. The Home Minister, who reviewed the security situation in the state, told reporters that over the past four to five months, there had been a big shift, as incidents of stone-pelting had come down and the recruitment of militants had also decreased. Singh met representatives of various political parties in Srinagar during his day-long visit and said he had appealed to all of them to participate in the upcoming panchayat polls in Jammu and Kashmir. He congratulated the state on the successful conduct of urban local bodies elections in a fair and transparent manner and said the holding of ULB and panchayat polls in the state is a historical step. Singh said those who do not believe in democracy can never be well-wishers of people. The National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had boycotted the recent urban bodies election in Jammu and Kashmir. Singh added that as far as talks are concerned, the government has no problem in holding dialogue with anyone. ""But there is a condition from our side. At least, they should see that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism in India and promoting terrorism also. Give us this much of assurance that there will not be any such attempt by Pakistan. Terror and dialogue both can never go together,"" he said. Asked if there was any initiative to hold talks with separatists, Singh said the government will talk to anyone who is willing to enter dialogue, but refused to elaborate. ""Government will not shy away from talks. We have been saying this time and again, anyone who wants to talk, we are ready,"" he said. He also said India had made all efforts on its part but Pakistan did not take any positive step to improve ties. In response to a question, the Home Minister said the Centre had no proposal to change any constitutional provision regarding Jammu and Kashmir. ""There is no initiative by the Centre on this (Article 35-A). The provisions in the Constitution are there and the Centre has not tinkered with any of those provisions. It is difficult to answer when a non-issue is made into an issue,"" he said. The Home Minister also said that the Centre and the state government were working together to improve the life of people of the state. ""We want to engage the youth of the state in a constructive way. The state government along with the Centre has taken several initiatives in this regard. Through the Home Ministry alone, we are providing 11,000 jobs by various initiatives which will be implemented in several stages.” ""Through various schemes of the central government, steps are afoot to provide employment to nearly 2.5 lakh youths of the state. Our government will provide all assistance needed that will help the youth of the state to chart their own destiny,"" he said. On the local bodies elections, Singh said it was for the first time that an attempt has been made to empower the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh through devolution of power. “Every panchayat of the state will get Rs 60 lakh to Rs 70 lakh every year for carrying out development works in their respective areas,” he said. ""The aim of empowering these bodies is to make them autonomous so that they can resolve their issues,"" he said. On Centre's interlocutor Dineshwar Sharma, the minister said he will continue in his role till talks are held. He termed the death of seven civilians in a blast as ""very unfortunate"" after an encounter had ended in Kulgam district of Jammu and Kashmir and appealed to people not to venture such places where security operations were on. The minister also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh for next of kin of the deceased. ""If there is an operation by security forces, I appeal the people that they should not try to go there. The security forces do take precautions and we have repeatedly directed them to do it,"" he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",PTI,The Quint
"  Firstpost. According to data released by pollster C-Voter, the Congress has a clear advantage in the upcoming Rajasthan Assembly election on 7 December, with Sachin Pilot enjoying a favourable rating compared to incumbent Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje of the BJP. The Congress' projected lead in the vote share over the BJP—47.9 to 39.7 percent—easily exceeds the margin of error, thereby reducing the likelihood of a verdict against the run of play in the contest for 200 Assembly seats, as per analysis done by C-Voter for   and  . As the BJP's fortunes have experienced a late surge between August and November 2018, the projected vote share gap between the Congress and BJP has reduced from 14 percent in August to eight percent. Taking into account the fact that the distribution of tickets has ended and last minute micro-management is in place, vote share trends may not differ substantially from here on, according to C-Voter. A disjointed BJP is unlikely to whittle down a Congress lead of 8 percent in the projected vote share, according to the pollster.  Congress is leading comfortably in the projected vote share in all five of Rajasthan's regions as per the C-Voter data. Congress is dominating the BJP comfortably in Dhundhar and Harouti, and has less than five percent lead in projected vote share only in Marwad and Mewar. This is indicative of a uniform anti-incumbency mood across the state with no pocket of BJP influence shining through in the polls, according to the pollster. The C-Voter poll predicted that the Congress will net 145 seats and the BJP will win only 55 seats in the 2018 Assembly election. In 2013,  the Congress won a mere 21 seats and the BJP won a whopping 163 seats. Congress' Sachin Pilot garnered 38.7 percent of votes from those polled and emerged by far the most popular candidate for the post of chief minister. Incumbent Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje of the BJP is a distant second with 22.7 percent respondents saying she would be the best candidate, followed closely by Congress' Ashok Gehlot, who got the nod from 20.5 percent of respondents. When respondents were specifically asked to choose between Pilot and Raje, Pilot emerged as most voters' preferred candidate: 50.6 percent of respondents picked Pilot, while only 31.9 percent picked Raje. C-Voter concluded that the Rajasthan Congress seems to be managing its affairs well by presenting a united face, that the BJP incumbent chief minister and the state government seem equally unpopular, that the BJP isn't in the hunt in any of Rajasthan's regions, that the gap in the projected vote share between BJP and Congress is too wide to be bridged by a late surge and that ticket distribution and micro-management have not been impacted much by projections. The CNX poll gives the BJP a projected 43.5 percent vote share and the Congress a 40.3 percent vote share.  The CSDS poll gave the Congress a projected 45 percent vote share and the BJP a 41 percent vote share. The CFORE poll gave the Congress a 50 percent vote share and the BJP a 43 percent vote share. The CNX poll predicts the BJP will win  75 seats and the Congress will net 115 seats.  The CSDS poll predicts 110 seats for the Congress and 84 seats for the BJP. The CFORE poll estimates 130 seats for the Congress and 65 seats for the BJP.",FP Staff,PTI

"Cracks seem to have emerged in the four-decade-old CPI(M)-led Left Front, with a section of its leaders advocating ""adjustment"" with the Congress in West Bengal while their allies are opposed to the idea. Miffed over the CPI(M)'s growing affinity with the Congress, once its arch-rival, allies such as the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB), the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) have expressed reservations over ""any understanding"" with the grand old party. The AIFB and the CPI have even threatened to quit the Front if the CPI(M) went ahead with the Congress for the 2019 general election. ""In the 2016 Assembly polls, when the CPI(M) entered into a seat-sharing adjustment with the Congress, we suffered badly. The adjustment has been disastrous for us and beneficial for the Congress,"" Chatterjee said. The nine-party-strong Left Front, which was in power in West Bengal for 34 years between 1977 and 2011, comprises CPI(M), RSP, CPI and Forward Bloc as its major partners. A section of West Bengal Congress unit has shown inclination to forge a tie-up with Left parties for defeating the BJP in 2019. The Left Front enjoys considerable support in West Bengal. In 2016, the CPI(M) had secured 19.8 per cent votes, CPI bagged 1.5 per cent, RSP 1.7 per cent and AIFB 2.8 per cent. According to senior Left Front leaders, the RSP, the FB and the CPI had opposed the idea of forming a coalition with the Congress, even before the 2016 Assembly polls. It was at the insistence of a section of CPI(M) leaders, who had floated the idea of ""people's alliance"", that the Front partners gave in to the proposal, they said. The CPI, which doesn't have any reservation in entering into an electoral understanding with the Congress in other states, said the political situation in Bengal is ""totally different"" and any understanding with the grand old party here would prove 'fatal' for both the CPI(M) and other Left Front partners. ""From our previous experience we can say that the Congress had failed to transfer its votes to the Left in case of an adjustment. It was proved in 2016 Assembly polls as well as the recent Maheshtala bypoll,"" CPI state secretary Swapan Banerjee said. The RSP went a step ahead, saying that the Left Front was not a ""personal property"" of the CPI(M). ""Although time is not ripe to comment on the issue of adjustment, we feel that the Left Front should fight on its own to regain its lost ground,"" RSP state secretary Kshiti Goswami told PTI. When contacted, several top CPI(M) leaders declined to comment on the issue and said it was too early to say anything on such matters. ""We have always advocated a strong Left Front. We don't want to talk about this matter as of now. Let time come, everything can be sorted through discussions,"" said a senior CPI(M) leader.

" Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday accused the Congress of adopting double standards on cow protection, saying that while the party talks of bovine protection in Madhya Pradesh, its workers in Kerala slaughtered a calf and claimed eating beef was their right. Addressing a rally in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh's Chhindwara, the home turf of state Congress chief Kamal Nath, Modi said the Opposition party had ""mastered the art of speaking lies"". He asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi, whom he addressed as "" "" (dynast), to clarify his party's stand on the issue of cow protection. ""The Congress talked about cows to confuse the voters in Madhya Pradesh. They can talk about cows, it is their right. But is Kerala Congress different?"" Modi asked. ""In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress manifesto talked about protecting cows, but in Kerala, its workers slaughtered a calf in open and circulated its pictures claiming it was their right to eat beef,"" he said. In May last year, Youth Congress activists allegedly publicly butchered a calf in Kerala's Kannur to protest the Centre's ban on sale of cattle for slaughtering. As the incident triggered protests, the central leadership of the Congress distanced itself from the issue and condemned the act as ""thoughtless and barbaric"". Modi also attacked Nath over a purported video of the Congress leader in which he allegedly said that the party only needed candidates who can win and it did not matter if they were corrupt, goons or facing criminal cases. ""Should Madhya Pradesh be saved from such people or not? Should the state go into such hands?"" the prime minister asked the people attending the rally. Polling for Madhya Pradesh's 230-member assembly will be held on 28 November. The incumbent BJP, which has been in power in Madhya Pradesh since 2003, is seeking a fourth straight term in the state.

""In India, we derive our strength from tolerance and respect our pluralism. We celebrate our diversity,"" he said. ""I am here to share my understanding on nation, nationalism and patriotism about our country which is 'Bharat',"" said Mukherjee, who served as President of India between 2012 and 2017.

"A nearly Rs 40,000 crore deal to procure S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems from Russia is yet to be concluded mainly due to differences over price which India would look to sort out during Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's upcoming visit to Moscow, official sources said. India wants to procure the long-range missile systems to tighten its air defence mechanism, particularly when China has been ramping up its military manoeuvring along the nearly 4,000 km Sino-India border. China was the first foreign buyer to seal a government-to-government deal with Russia in 2014 to procure the lethal missile system and Moscow has already started delivery of unknown number of the S-400 missile systems to China. ""Sealing the S-400 deal will be a major focus of Sitharaman's visit to Russia,"" said a source familiar with the deal, which would be one of biggest with Russia in recent years. Negotiators from both countries have been in talks for over one and half years for the purchase of at least five systems of S-400 which are capable of firing three types of missiles, creating a layered defence. The sources also said that no decision could be taken on the long-pending fifth-generation fighter jet project with Russia due to the high cost involved in it. A high-level committee set up by the government to examine various aspects of the project had submitted its report last year and the defence ministry is likely to take a call on it soon. In 2007, India and Russia had inked an inter-governmental pact for the FGFA project. In December 2010, India had agreed to pay USD 295 million (Rs 1,897 crore) towards the preliminary design of the fighter, which is called in India as the 'Perspective Multi-role Fighter'. However, the negotiations faced various hurdles in the subsequent years. In February 2016, India and Russia revived talks on the project after a clearance from the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar. The issue may also figure during Sitharaman's visit to Moscow.
